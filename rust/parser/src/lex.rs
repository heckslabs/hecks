//! The lexer — comment/blank-line stripping, and the shape gate (the first

//! module doc in main.rs).
//!
//! A `.bluebook` line must be one of a small fixed set of forms: a bare
//! word call (`aggregate "Pizza" do`, `attribute :name, String`, `end`).
//! Bare Ruby expressions, `if`/`unless`/control flow, and local variable
//! assignment are hard errors here — never silently skipped, never
//! interpreted as Ruby. This is deliberate and load-bearing: the DSL *is*
//! real Ruby underneath (`instance_eval`'d against builder objects), but
//! this parser never runs a Ruby interpreter, so it can only ever admit
//! the shapes it explicitly recognizes.
