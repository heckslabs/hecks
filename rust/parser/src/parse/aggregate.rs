//! The `Aggregate` construct (`lib/hecks/bluebook/ir/aggregate.rb`,
//! built by `Hecks::Bluebook::DSL::AggregateBuilder`). STAGE 3 adds
//! the MULTI-PATH `identified_by do ... end`/`identified_by { ... }`
//! source form (`build/identity.rs`'s own header explains why it needs no
//! `build/*.rs` derivation at all — its body IS the identity, captured
//! raw) and inline `one_of(...)` closed-set synthesis
//! (`build/closed_sets.rs`) folded into this aggregate's own
//! `value_objects`. STAGE 4 adds `provenance` (a raw captured Hash,
//! `ir::Literal` — see `ir.rs`'s own comment), a nested `policy` (hoisted
//! onto the CHAPTER by Ruby's own `AggregateBuilder#policy`, so this
//! module returns it SEPARATELY rather than folding it into
//! `ir::Aggregate` — `parse::chapter`'s own header explains the bubbling
//! order), `belongs_to`/`has_one` (`has_many` stays unbuilt — no real
//! corpus member exercises it yet), and a real `entity` (`parse::entity`,
//! previously fully stubbed). Still open: the bare-FIELD `identified_by`
//! form (`identified_by :field`, not exercised by any real corpus member
//! yet).

/// SOURCE (block) form needs no such deferral — its paths are already

/// `AggregateBuilder#identified_by`'s own `@identity_paths = paths`
/// direct assignment.
///
/// Inline `one_of(...)` closed sets (`attribute :tone, one_of(...)`) are
/// collected SEPARATELY from `value_object "Name" do ... end` blocks and
/// appended AFTER them — mirroring `AggregateBuilder#build`'s own
/// `@value_objects + closed_sets` ORDER exactly (confirmed against
/// console_settings.bluebook's own `StateStyle`: its three explicit
/// `value_object`s come first in `ir.json`, `Tone` — synthesized from
/// `attribute :tone, one_of(...)`, written BEFORE two of those three in
/// the source — comes last regardless).
/// Returns the built aggregate ALONGSIDE any `policy`s declared directly
/// inside it — `AggregateBuilder#policy` HOISTS a nested policy onto the
/// CHAPTER (`IR::Policy#aggregate`'s own comment: "a policy written
/// inside an aggregate is HOISTED onto the chapter by the builder"), and
/// `IR::Aggregate#to_h` never spells `policies` at all — confirmed by
/// reading `aggregate.rb` directly. So this can't fold a nested policy
/// into `ir::Aggregate` the way it does `commands`/`queries`/etc; the
/// caller (`parse::chapter`) bubbles the returned `Vec<ir::Policy>` onto
/// `ir::Bluebook.policies` itself, in the exact order
/// `BluebookBuilder#build`'s own `@aggregates.flat_map(&:policies) +
/// @policies` produces (every aggregate's own policies, in aggregate
/// order, THEN every chapter-level one).
/// BARE `given(desc)` — CHAPTER-WIDE REFERENCE
/// (`docs/implemented/resolution-rules/chapter-given.md`). Mirrors `parse::command::
/// try_reference_named_given`'s own shape one level up: peeks the next
/// physical line WITHOUT consuming it unless it actually matches (word
/// `given`, `Opener::None`) — anything else (a fresh `given("x") { ... }`
/// declaration, or any other word entirely) falls through untouched to
/// the ordinary `next_line` gate, which already handles it.
///
/// `AggregateBuilder#given`'s own bare-reference form has no narrower
/// "in-between" scope to check first — an aggregate is not nested inside
/// anything else `given` could mean here — so, unlike the command-level
/// version, there is only ONE pool to check: `chapter_named_givens`.
///
/// KEYED BY (owner name, `Given`) PAIRS, not a flat `Given` list — a
/// SECOND aggregate can independently declare the SAME description under
/// a genuinely DIFFERENT canonical (real corpus: `Account`'s own
/// "customer is active" reads bare `customer.status`; `ATMCard`'s own
/// reads `account.customer.status`, reached through `Account`), so this
/// mirrors `AggregateBuilder#given`'s own Ruby-side `declared_by:`
/// disambiguation (`docs/implemented/resolution-rules/chapter-given.md`) rather than
/// the earlier single-candidate-only shape: an OPTIONAL `declared_by:
/// SomeAggregate` argument picks the exact owner when more than one
/// candidate is registered under the same description; omitted, it
/// resolves only when EXACTLY one candidate exists — never guesses among
/// several.
///
/// A CHAPTER MAY BE SPLIT ACROSS FILES — the target of a bare reference
/// here may be declared in a file that has not been parsed YET, the
/// mirror of Ruby's own `AggregateBuilder#pending_chapter_given`
/// (`BluebookBuilder#resolve_pending_chapter_givens!`, run once every
/// file in the chapter has loaded). So "not found among `chapter_named_
/// givens` so far" is no longer immediately refused here — only genuine
/// AMBIGUITY is (more files can only ADD candidates, never remove one,
/// so a conflict seen now stays a conflict regardless of what loads
/// later). `ChapterGivenLookup::Pending` carries everything the final
/// pass (`parse::chapter::parse_chapter`'s own resolution loop, after
/// every file has contributed to `chapter_named_givens`) needs to
