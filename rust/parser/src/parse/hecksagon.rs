/// and mutates the registered aggregates' own `ports`, via
/// `HecksagonBuilder#port`/`BindingProxy#port` -> `IR::Aggregate#
/// add_port`). Two things ever reach `ir.json` from here (finding #5):
/// an aggregate-scoped `port ... do ... end` and `uses_framework` (not
/// exercised by pizzas.hecksagon, which declares neither a bare root
/// port nor a framework member — both still real, gated paths below).
/// Everything else (`persisted_by`, `projected_by`, `subscribe`, any
/// other adapter-bind verb) is the plan's own named open-vocabulary
/// escape: shape-matched, never interpreted, its content dropped.
///
/// `uses_framework_names` — STAGE 8 addition: every `uses_framework
/// "X"` argument encountered, pushed in file order, so `hecks-parse
/// resolve` (parse::chapter::resolve_hecksagon_dependencies, the ONLY other
/// caller that cares) can report them back to `bin/project_rust`'s
/// opt-in Rust orchestration path without a second pass over the file.
/// `parse_chapter`'s own call sites (both the matching AND the
/// discarded-sibling-block cases) pass a throwaway `&mut Vec::new()` —
/// `ir.json` itself still carries no `uses_framework` key at all (this
/// module's own header, finding #5), so `chapter`'s own callers have no
/// use for the collected names.
///
/// `require_matching_aggregate` — STAGE 8 addition: `parse_chapter`
/// passes `true` (the original, only behavior before this stage) —
/// `bluebook` there is either the REAL accumulator (already carrying
/// every aggregate the sibling `.bluebook` file just registered) or a
/// same-shape discarded one for a sibling chapter's own block, so an
/// aggregate-scoped `port` line naming an aggregate that doesn't exist
/// is a genuine error either way. `resolve_hecksagon_dependencies` passes
/// `false`: it never sees a `.bluebook` file at all (by design — see
/// `main.rs::run_resolve`'s own header on why `hecks-parse resolve`
/// takes only the `.hecksagon` path), so its `ir::Bluebook::default()`
/// accumulator NEVER carries real aggregates — a real `port` line
/// (pizzas.hecksagon's own `Pizzas::Order.port "PaymentGateway"`) would
/// otherwise fail this exact lookup on every single resolve call, for a
/// construct resolve doesn't even report. The body still gates fully
/// either way (fail-closed holds); only the "attach onto a real
/// aggregate" step is skipped when `false`.
///
/// `vendored_bluebook_names` — same STAGE 8 shape as
/// `uses_framework_names`, one line below: every `uses_embryonaut_
/// bluebook "X"` argument encountered, pushed in file order. Same
/// caller (`hecks-parse resolve`), same reason: a vendored package is
/// attached the SAME `Kernel.load`-into-registry way a framework member
/// is (`lib/hecks/embryonaut_bluebook.rb`'s own header — "same shape as
/// Framework"), so the opt-in Rust-native pipeline needs to discover it
/// the same way, from the SAME `.hecksagon` scan, or it silently drops
/// the vendored chapter entirely while the default Ruby path still
/// generates it — a real divergence, not a hypothetical one.
