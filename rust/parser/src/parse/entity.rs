//! The `Entity` construct (`lib/hecks/bluebook/ir/entity.rb`, built
//! by `Hecks::Bluebook::DSL::EntityBuilder`) — a piece of an
//! aggregate with an identity of its own. STAGE 4: `EntityBuilder`
//! `include AttributeCollector`, the SAME module `AggregateBuilder` does,
//! and its own `identified_by` is (per its own comment) "the aggregate's
//! method line for line" — so this mirrors `parse::aggregate`'s own
//! `identified_by` handling exactly, via the SHARED `parse::
//! parse_identified_by`/`PendingIdentity` (`parse::mod`'s own header) —
//! not a second, parallel copy. A piece says less than a head
//! (syntax.bluebook's own comment): no `value_object`, no `policy`, no
//! nested `entity`, no `reference_to` — the words an entity actually
//! declares are `description`/`identified_by`/`attribute`/`command`/
//! `query`/`lifecycle`, confirmed real by banking.bluebook's own
//! `LedgerEntry`/`Withdrawal`/`Visit`/`KeyIssuance` (composite AND
//! single-path identities, both TYPE and block/Paths forms). S17, ADR
//! 0026 added a sixth: `entity`, nesting a piece inside a piece
//! (`Dispatch`, inside `Handler`, reaction.bluebook) — "no `value_object`,
//! no `policy`, no nested `entity`, no `reference_to`" is no longer
//! quite the whole list ; `reference_to` is still the one real omission.
//! ADR 0028 added a seventh word: `given`, a precondition shared across
//! this piece's OWN commands, declared once — the SAME move
//! `parse::aggregate`'s own `given` arm already makes, one level up
//! (real corpus motivation: banking.bluebook's own `LedgerEntry`, whose
//! `Amend`/`Reverse` used to repeat two `given` blocks byte for byte).
//!
//! A FOURTH `given` SCOPE — CHAPTER-WIDE, ENTITY-SCOPED sharing, one
//! level below `parse::aggregate`'s own chapter-wide sharing
//! (`try_reference_named_chapter_given`) — lets two DIFFERENT
//! aggregates' own nested entities share a predicate across the
//! aggregate boundary, mirroring `EntityBuilder#given_impl`'s own
//! `declared_by:` bare-reference form exactly one level down. Real
//! corpus motivation: `Account::LedgerEntry` and
//! `SafeDepositBox::Visit` — two pieces under two DIFFERENT aggregates —
//! independently typed the identical `given("customer is active") {
//! parent.customer.status == "active" }`; `Visit` now instead spells
//! `given("customer is active", declared_by: "Account.LedgerEntry")`.
//! See `try_reference_named_chapter_entity_given`'s own header for the
//! resolution algorithm and `PendingChapterEntityGiven`'s own header for
//! how a chapter split across files is handled.
