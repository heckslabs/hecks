//! The `Bluebook` construct — the top of the construct chain
//! (`lib/hecks/bluebook/ir/bluebook.rb`), and the driver for
//! `hecks-parse chapter --chapter <Name> <files...>`.
//!
//! Parses each `.bluebook` file's header + body into one `ir::Bluebook`,
//! then applies any `.hecksagon` file(s) given onto the already-built
//! result (`parse::hecksagon::apply`) — mirroring `bin/project_rust`'s
//! own real load order: the domain's `.bluebook` loads and registers
//! every aggregate first, its `.hecksagon` loads second and mutates
//! those already-registered aggregates (attaching ports).
//!
//! Stage 6: a chapter split across several `.bluebook` files
//! (`MetaValidator::GRAMMAR_FILES`, discovered concept files sharing one chapter name —
//! the self-hosted language parsing its own grammar) is now real,
//! mirroring `BluebookBuilder.build`'s own accumulating-builder shape
//! (`meta_validator.rb`'s own comment: "`BluebookBuilder.build` keeps
//! one builder open per chapter name across calls ... so loading all
//! the folder in order accumulates one domain"). Concretely: every
//! `Bluebook`-context file's body is parsed into the same `ir::Bluebook`
//! accumulator, in file order — `aggregate`/`policy`/`report`/
//! `process_manager` all append across files exactly as they do within
//! one file, while `vision`/`core`/`supporting`/`generic`/
//! `formerly_known_as` (single-value fields) are set, not reset, by a
//! later file that doesn't mention them — matching
//! `BluebookBuilder#vision`/`#core`/etc.'s own plain `@ivar = value`
//! assignment, never touched by a file that has no such line. The
//! Header metadata belongs to the composed chapter, not the first filename:
//! Ruby's open builder adopts a non-empty `version:` from whichever concept
//! file declares it and refuses conflicting versions. This makes sorted folder
//! discovery independent of a specially ordered metadata file.
//!
//! Stage 4 finding: a single `.hecksagon` file may declare more than one
//! `Hecks.hecksagon "Name" do ... end` block — banking.hecksagon's own
//! shape, confirmed real: after the `"Banking"` block (the one this
//! chapter's own binds live in), the same file also carries sibling
//! `Hecks.hecksagon "Governance" do ... end`/`"Identity"` blocks (their
//! own comment explains why: a persistence bind belongs beside the
//! aggregate whose registry it's found under, not beside whichever
//! domain's own `.hecksagon` happens to `uses_framework` it — so
//! Governance/Identity's own binds sit in this same physical file rather
//! than a nonexistent `framework/bluebook/governance.hecksagon`). Every
//! block in the file is still gated for real (fail-closed holds for all
//! of them, not just the one this chapter cares about) — only the block
//! whose own declared name matches `chapter_name` is applied onto the
//! real `bluebook`; every other one is applied onto a throwaway,
//! discarded `ir::Bluebook`, so a real syntax error inside a sibling
//! block still refuses rather than being silently skipped.
