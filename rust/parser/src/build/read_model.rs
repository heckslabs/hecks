//! Mirrors a read model's `include` head gathering — pluralization,
//! dedup, and the `many:`/`as:` shape each `aggregate_heads` row carries
//! (`ReadModelBuilder#add_aggregate_head`).
//!
//! `aggregate_heads` below, called from `parse::read_model`, handles both
//! shapes for real: rootless (no `reference_to` — confirmed real by
//! console_settings.bluebook's `Styles`/`Curated` reports, every
//! `include`d head `many: true`) and rooted (`reference_to` declared —
//! confirmed real, and under live byte-exact parity testing today, by
//! Banking's `CustomerPortfolio`/`ComplianceDashboard`), correctly
//! splitting `many: target != reference_target` for whichever
//! `reference_target` is passed in. `group_by`'s own field list needs no
//! derivation beyond "the bare symbol names given" — handled directly in
//! `parse::read_model` instead of a function here, the same "trivial
//! enough not to need its own module function" call
//! `build/query_derive.rs`'s own header already makes for `sets`' four
//! named forms living beside `where`'s.
