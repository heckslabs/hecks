//! Mirrors `AttributeCollector#synthesise_closed_set` — an inline
//! `attribute :status, one_of("open", "shut")` desugars to a value object
//! named `Naming.pascal(attribute_name)`, with one `value: String`
//! attribute and one member per listed value, `closed_set: true`. Also
//! covers `one_of do member ... end` (the standalone, named form,
//! `parse::value_object`'s own `parse_one_of_body`) and `member`'s own
//! pairs-row capture (`PairsShape::verbatim` — each member's fields are
//! an open map, never resolved against a fixed schema).
//!
//! Stage 3: `synthesize` below, called from `parse::mod::
//! resolve_type_expression` — confirmed real by console_settings.
//! bluebook's `StateStyle.tone`/`Collection.identity_strategy`
//! (`attribute :tone, one_of("good", "warn", "danger", "muted",
//! "accent"), optional: true`).
