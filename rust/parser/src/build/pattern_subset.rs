//! Mirrors `Hecks::Bluebook::PatternSubset`
//! (`lib/hecks/bluebook/pattern_subset.rb`) — which regexes a
//! bluebook may say in `attribute ..., pattern: ...`. A declared pattern
//! is a fact carried in the bluebook, not Ruby code, so it must not lean
//! on what any one engine happens to accept: backreferences/lookaround/
//! atomic groups/possessive quantifiers can't be matched in linear time
//! and portable engines refuse them outright; perl (`\d`/`\w`/`\s`) and
//! POSIX (`[:digit:]`) character classes are the dangerous half — every
//! engine parses them, but ASCII in some and Unicode in others, so
//! nothing ever errors and two adapters silently disagree. `refuse_
//! unshared_pattern` (`attribute_collector.rb`) calls this at
//! declaration time, and `attribute`'s own row is what this parser has to
//! refuse the same way — confirmed real by banking.bluebook's own
//! `EmailAddress` value object, whose own comment names exactly this
//! module as the reason its pattern is spelled with explicit ranges
//! (`[^@ ]`) rather than `\S`.
//!
//! A character walk, deliberately plain, mirroring Ruby's own line for
//! line — the subset is defined by this walk, not by handing the pattern
//! to a real regex engine and asking what it thinks.
