//! `hecks-parse` — the fresh, purpose-built Rust parser for hecks's
//! own `.bluebook` DSL (see `/Users/christopheryoung/.claude/plans/sequential-petting-whale.md`
//! for the full 8-stage plan this crate is Stage 1 of).
//!
//! STAGE 1: crate skeleton, lexer, generated keyword table, and all four
//! parsing gates wired — with every per-construct handler
//! (`parse::aggregate`, `parse::entity`, ...) stubbed to a clear
//! `not_yet_implemented` diagnostic. The differential harness
//! (`spec/parser_parity_spec.rb`, `spec/parser_coverage_spec.rb`) exists
//! and runs GREEN, with an itemized pending list, before this parser
//! implements anything real — that ordering is the plan's actual
//! methodological difference from two previous, failed hand-written
//! Rust bluebook parsers (see the plan's own framing).
//!
//! THE FOUR GATES every line goes through (see parse/mod.rs and lex.rs
//! for where each actually lives):
//!   1. shape     — a line must be one of a small fixed set of forms;
//!                  bare Ruby expressions/`if`/local assignment are hard
//!                  errors (lex.rs::classify).
//!   2. word      — the leading identifier must hit a row in the
//!                  GENERATED `keywords.rs::KEYWORDS` table for the
//!                  current context (parse::word_gate).
//!   3. body      — `none`/`keywords`/`source`/`rows` must match what
//!                  actually follows (parse::body_gate).
//!   4. argument  — positional/named count and lexical kind must match
//!                  the declared `keywords.rs::ARGUMENTS` row(s)
//!                  (parse::argument_gate).
//!
//! **NO LENIENT/BEST-EFFORT MODE, EVER.** An unrecognized construct is
//! always a hard error, never silently skipped — see diag.rs's own
//! header for why this is the single most important invariant here.
