//! Diagnostics — the one shape every refusal in this crate takes.
//!
//! **No lenient mode, ever.** An unrecognized construct is always a hard
//! error, never silently skipped — that's the single most important design
//! invariant in the whole Rust-parser plan (see the plan's framing of why
//! `~/Projects/hecks/rust`'s own abandoned parser was dangerous: it "failed
//! open", returning valid for a real bluebook file while silently dropping
//! identity). A `Diagnostic` is how every gate (shape/word/argument/body)
//! reports that hard failure — always naming the file, the line, what was
//! found, and what would have been legal instead.
