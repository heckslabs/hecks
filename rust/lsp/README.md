# hecks-lsp

A minimal Language Server Protocol front end for `.bluebook`/`.hecksagon`
files. It doesn't parse anything itself — it shells out to `rust/parser`'s
own `hecks-parse` binary and turns whatever that says into
`textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notifications. See `src/main.rs`'s and
`src/diagnostics.rs`'s own header comments for the reasoning; this file
is setup + roadmap.

## What it does today

- `initialize` / `initialized` / `shutdown` / `exit`
- `textDocument/didOpen` / `didChange` (full sync) / `didSave` / `didClose`
- On every one of those, stages the buffer to a scratch file and runs
  `hecks-parse chapter --chapter <Name> <scratch file>`, where `<Name>`
  is scraped from the buffer's own `Hecks.bluebook "Name"` /
  `Hecks.hecksagon "Name"` line. A clean parse publishes an empty
  diagnostics list; a failure publishes exactly one `Diagnostic`
  (`rust/parser` stops at the first error, so there is never more than
  one to report — see `diagnostics.rs`).
- Diagnostics carry the parser's real message and its `expected one of:
  ...` list, at `severity: Warning` when the cause is
  `not_yet_implemented` (a real Stage 1 gap, not a bug in your file) and
  `severity: Error` otherwise.
- `textDocument/documentSymbol` — an outline of every
  `aggregate`/`entity`/`value_object`/`command`/`query`/`policy`/
  `process_manager`/`read_model` in the open file, nested by `do`/`end`
  depth. Sourced from a text scan of the buffer (`outline.rs`), not from
  `hecks-parse`'s own IR — see that file's header for why (short version:
  the IR carries no source line for anything, and often fails to build
  at all under Stage 1's still-partial coverage, so this needed to work
  independently of a parse succeeding).
- `textDocument/definition` — resolves the bare identifier under the
  cursor (a `reference_to Customer` / `belongs_to Account` usage) to
  wherever that aggregate/entity/value_object is actually declared,
  first in the same file, then across sibling `.bluebook`/`.hecksagon`
  files in the same directory (a chapter routinely spans several files —
  `parse::chapter`'s own header — and the declaration is often in one of
  them, not the file doing the referencing).

## What it doesn't do yet

- **`documentSymbol`/`definition` are text-scanned, not grammar-verified.**
  Real, but a second, unverified idea of the grammar rather than a
  projection of `syntax.bluebook` the way `rust/parser`'s own
  `keywords.rs` is — see `outline.rs`'s header for the reasoning and its
  one real failure mode (a buffer with unbalanced `do`/`end` mid-edit).
  Only `aggregate`/`entity`/`value_object` names are valid `definition`
  targets (`outline::is_reference_target`) — a `command`/`query` name
  is never referenced by a bare identifier elsewhere in the corpus the
  way a type name is, so it isn't one.
- **No column info.** `rust/parser`'s own `Diagnostic` only tracks a
  line, so every diagnostic underlines the whole line. Real squiggle
  precision needs `rust/parser` to track columns first — nothing to fix
  here until then.
- **No completion or hover.** The parser's gates
  (`rust/parser/src/parse/mod.rs`: shape → word → body → argument)
  already encode "what's legal at this point in the grammar" — that's
  exactly what a completion engine needs, but it's not exposed as
  anything this crate can call today. The clean way to add it, in
  keeping with `rust/parser` staying a subprocess-only sibling
  (see `diagnostics.rs`'s header): add a new `hecks-parse` subcommand
  (e.g. `hecks-parse complete --chapter <Name> <file> --line N --col N`)
  that runs the same gates up to the cursor and prints the legal next
  words as JSON, the same shape `run_coverage` already prints its list
  in. Once that exists, wiring `textDocument/completion` here is a small
  addition, not a redesign.
- **Only one diagnostic per document.** Inherited from `rust/parser`'s
  own fail-fast design (`parse::chapter`'s doc comment: "Stops at the
  FIRST diagnostic"). If that ever becomes a `Vec<Diagnostic>`, this
  crate's `diagnostics::run` only needs to return `Vec<FileDiagnostic>`
  instead of `Option<FileDiagnostic>` — `main.rs` already publishes
  whatever list it's handed.
- **Single-file chapters only.** A chapter split across multiple
  `.bluebook` files, or paired with a `.hecksagon` file
  (`parse::chapter`'s own header describes both), is only ever checked
  one file at a time here. Fine for every example under `examples/*/`
  today; would need this crate to also track a project's file layout
  (which files share a chapter name) to do better.

## Building it

```
cd rust/parser && cargo build   # produces target/debug/hecks-parse
cd rust/lsp    && cargo build   # produces target/debug/hecks-lsp
```

`hecks-lsp` looks for `hecks-parse` in this order: `$HECKS_PARSE_BIN`,
then `$PATH`, then `../parser/target/{debug,release}/hecks-parse`
relative to wherever it's launched from (the common case while both
crates are built side by side out of one checkout). If none of those
resolve, it still runs — every document just gets an empty diagnostics
list and one `window/logMessage` warning explaining why.

## Wiring it into an editor

**Neovim** (`nvim-lspconfig`, manual server since this isn't a published
server yet):

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
  pattern = { "ruby" }, -- .bluebook/.hecksagon have no LSP-registered
                         -- filetype of their own yet; match on extension
                         -- instead if you've set one up, or broaden this
  callback = function(args)
    local fname = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(args.buf)
    if not (fname:match("%.bluebook$") or fname:match("%.hecksagon$")) then
      return
    end
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = "hecks-lsp",
      cmd = { "/absolute/path/to/rust/lsp/target/debug/hecks-lsp" },
      root_dir = vim.fs.dirname(fname),
    })
  end,
})
```

**VS Code**: `editors/vscode/` (repo root) is a minimal real extension —
see its own README for build/install steps. Not published to the
marketplace; installed locally (copy into your extensions directory, or
F5 an Extension Development Host). Its syntax highlighting is Ruby's own grammar
under the extension's scope name (see its README), plus the language client wiring.

## Testing it without an editor

`cargo test` covers the pure functions (`chapter_name` extraction,
`Diagnostic` line parsing, JSON round-tripping). For a full stdio
round-trip, speak Content-Length-framed JSON-RPC to the process
directly — `initialize` → `initialized` → `textDocument/didOpen` with a
real `.bluebook`'s text → read the `publishDiagnostics` notification
that comes back.
