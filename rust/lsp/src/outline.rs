//! A text-only outline of a `.bluebook`/`.hecksagon` buffer — every
//! named top-level construct (`aggregate "Order" do` ... `end`), nested
//! by `do`/`end` depth, with the line range each spans. Backs both
//! `textDocument/documentSymbol` and `textDocument/definition`
//! (`main.rs` resolves a bare identifier by searching outlines for a
//! symbol of that name).
//!
//! Deliberately not sourced from `hecks-parse`'s own IR, unlike
//! `diagnostics.rs`: `rust/parser/src/ir.rs` carries no source line for
//! any construct (confirmed — there is no `line` field anywhere in it),
//! so there is nothing to navigate to even when a parse fully succeeds.
//! And a parse often doesn't fully succeed yet — Stage 1 stubs return
//! `not_yet_implemented` for whole construct kinds
//! (`rust/parser/src/main.rs::COVERED_PAIRS`'s own header), which would
//! leave `documentSymbol` empty for most of the real corpus if it only
//! ever ran after a clean parse. This scans the buffer directly instead
//! — line-based, no dependency on `hecks-parse` succeeding at all — at
//! the cost of being a second, unverified idea of the grammar rather
//! than a projection of `syntax.bluebook` the way `rust/parser`'s own
//! `keywords.rs` is (see that file's header, and `rust/lsp/README.md`'s
//! own note on this trade-off). The eight keywords below are read
//! straight off `syntax.bluebook`'s own `Bluebook`/`Aggregate` argument
//! lists, not guessed, and kept to exactly the constructs worth jumping
//! to — this is an outline, not a parser.
//!
//! The grammar's own regularity is what makes this safe: `rust/parser`'s
//! own lexer refuses any line that isn't one of a small fixed set of
//! shapes (`lex.rs::classify` — no bare Ruby expressions, no `if`, no
//! local assignment ever admitted), so a real, well-formed `.bluebook`
//! file only ever opens a block with a line ending in `do` and closes it
//! with a line that is bare `end` — no one-line `do ... end`, no
//! `do |args|` block parameters anywhere in the real corpus (confirmed:
//! `grep -n 'do |' examples/**/*.bluebook` finds none). A do/end depth
//! counter is a much shakier idea in general Ruby; it's a reasonably
//! safe one here.
//!
//! A buffer mid-edit can have unbalanced `do`/`end` — the one real
//! failure mode: a stack that never pops (later symbols nest under a
//! long-since-should-have-closed one) or pops early. Self-corrects the
//! next time depth balances out; never panics either way.
