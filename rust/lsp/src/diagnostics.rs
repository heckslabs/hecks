//! Bridges one open `.bluebook`/`.hecksagon` buffer to `hecks-parse` and
//! back to an LSP `Diagnostic` array.
//!
//! Deliberately a subprocess, not a library call: `rust/parser` ships
//! only a `[[bin]]` target, on purpose (its own Cargo.toml: "this crate
//! reads bytes and writes JSON text by hand ... no dependency earns its
//! way past std", and its own workspace-isolation comment rules out
//! being folded into a shared lib). Restructuring it into a lib crate
//! this one could link was avoided the same way `rust/build/src/json.rs`
//! already avoided it for a different sibling — every one of these
//! crates stays a stable, subprocess-only sibling of `rust/parser`
//! rather than a thing that could accidentally start sharing (and so
//! coupling to) its internals. The real, load-bearing side effect: this
//! LSP's diagnostics get more accurate for free as `hecks-parse` itself
//! grows past its current Stage — nothing here needs to change when a
//! stub in `rust/parser/src/parse/*.rs` becomes real.
//!
//! **One diagnostic per run**: `hecks-parse chapter` stops at the first
//! error (`parse::chapter`'s own doc comment: "Stops at the first
//! diagnostic"), so this can only ever publish zero or one diagnostic
//! per document per run — a real limitation inherited from the parser's
//! own fail-fast design, not something this crate works around. Once
//! `rust/parser` collects multiple diagnostics per run, this module's
//! `run` only needs to map `Vec<Diagnostic>` instead of `Option<Diagnostic>`
//! — everything else here already speaks in terms of a list.
//!
//! **No column information**: `Diagnostic` (`rust/parser/src/diag.rs`) only
//! ever names a file and a line, never a column — so every diagnostic
//! this crate publishes underlines the full line, not a precise span.
//! Good enough for "something on this line is wrong, click through to
//! read why" (the message and `expected` list carry the real content);
//! real squiggle precision needs `rust/parser` to start tracking columns
//! first.
