// THE MATCHING LOGIC FOR THE GENERATED `QueryComparator` ENUM.
//
// The enum itself — variants, `ALL`, `name`, `from_name` — is
// `vocab::QueryComparator`, projected from `Vocabulary::QueryComparator`
// (language/bluebook/vocabulary.bluebook) by bin/project_rust_vocabulary
// and diffed by CI's checks_codegen_drift. It is re-exported here so every
// existing `kernel::query_comparators::QueryComparator` path (the
// generated domain registries, named_query.rs, read_model.rs, cli.rs)
// keeps compiling. A name the language gains is a new variant, and
// `matches` below stops compiling until it handles it — no hand-kept
// variant list, `ALL`, or `parse` table is left to drift.
//
// GROUND TRUTH FOR THE MATCHING LOGIC ITSELF, read directly rather than
// guessed at: `QuerySpecification::Common::Comparison#holds?`
// (lib/hecks/query_specification/common/comparison.rb), the one comparator
// table both Ruby query engines share. Proven against real cases by
// spec/query_comparators_spec.rb (the banking bluebook) and
// spec/adapters/query_agreement_spec.rb (Memory, Sqlite, Postgres, D1).
//
// WHAT DISPATCHES HERE, TODAY: `kernel/cli.rs`'s ad hoc, single-clause
// "query" step — the OBJECT form, `{"aggregate", "field", "op", "value"}`
// — via `repository.rs`'s `filter_entries`; and a NAMED/declared bluebook
// `query "X" do ... end` ask (`rust/project/queries.rb`/
// `kernel/named_query.rs`) for the subset expressible as field-comparator
// conditions against one aggregate's own attributes. A where clause that
// HOPS THROUGH A REFERENCE (`customer.status`) stays ungenerated —
// `rust/project/queries.rb`'s own header has the argument. `NoneInState`
// has real matching logic (`none_in_state_matches`, below) but is never
// generated as a condition: no generated call site can hand it the
// cross-domain search list it needs yet.
