// HAND-WRITTEN, ONCE, GENERIC — a direct port of `Dispatcher#dispatch`'s
// own reaction plumbing (lib/hecks/runtime/dispatcher.rb, read
// directly): every command dispatch runs its OWN pipeline, then hands
// each event it announced to policy matching AND process-manager
// advancement, re-entering dispatch for whatever either fires —
// recursively, inside the SAME call, bounded by a reaction-depth ceiling
// rather than a queue or a separate tick. `PolicyInterpreter#react`+
// `SagaInterpreter#advance` are the Ruby originals this ports; both run
// off the SAME announced-event list, in the order C10.2 fixes for both
// runtimes — the whole batch logged first, then per event in `emits`
// order: that event's policies, then its sagas (`Outbox::Relay#deliver`'s
// own loop) — which is why they're one function here too, not two.
//
// THE REACTION/SAGA LOG (`registry.reaction_log`/`saga_log`) IS PRODUCED
// NOW, not just the side effects — `PolicyInterpreter#deliver`'s and
// `SagaInterpreter`'s own record-building, ported record shape for record
// shape (`begin_saga`/`advance_saga`/`deliver_saga_dispatch`/`unwind`/
// `end_saga`, split into the SAME five functions below rather than one
// merged pass, because Ruby's own `advance` calls all three of `begin_
// saga`/`advance_saga`/`end_saga` UNCONDITIONALLY per (pm, event) pair —
// each independently gated on its own structural check (`event.name ==
// pm.starts_on`, `pm.handler_for(event.name)`, `event.name == pm.ends_on`)
// — and a single merged gate (this file's OWN prior shape) silently
// produces fewer log entries than Ruby whenever those three checks
// would have disagreed about whether to fire at all.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED, PERMANENT GAP: Ruby's `rescue StandardError`
// branch (`delivered: false, defect: true, error_class: ...`) has no
// Rust equivalent and is NOT ported. That branch exists because Ruby's
// dynamically-typed interpreter can raise a NoMethodError/TypeError/etc.
// from WITHIN a reaction dispatch — a genuine runtime crash a static,
// compiled `dispatch_fn` (`Result<Vec<Event>, Refusal>`, never an
// exception) cannot produce the equivalent of. A bug in generated Rust
// dispatch code is a Rust bug (a compile error, or — if it ever slipped
// through — a panic), and a panic here should propagate and abort, not
// be caught and logged as if it were routine: that is exactly the
// swallow-a-crash-into-normal-operation failure mode Ruby's own comment
// on this branch (`policy_interpreter.rb`) warns against, just prevented
// one layer earlier, by the type system, instead of guarded against at
// runtime. `spec/rust_conformance_spec.rb`'s own comparison excludes
// Ruby's `defect: true` reaction_log entries for exactly this reason —
// see that file's own header.
//
// CROSS-DOMAIN POLICIES (`across "OtherDomain"`) are matched here the
// SAME way a same-domain policy is (event_name/event_qualifier), but
// never dispatched here — this module is the WASM-sandboxed kernel
// (docs/implemented/decisions/0012), no network, no way to reach another domain's
// own deployed Lambda. `react_policies` below pushes a
// `PendingCrossDomainReaction` instead of recursing into `orchestrate`,
// and `kernel::cli::run` carries that list out through this call's own
// JSON output for rust/host (the UNSANDBOXED layer, real AWS SDK access)
// to actually deliver — `rust/host/src/lambda_client.rs` is that
// delivery, a direct port of `Adapters::Lambda::Client`'s own
// function-name computation and invoke shape. See that file's own header
// for the full mirror. NEITHER SIDE OF THAT SPLIT PRODUCES A `reaction_
// log` ENTRY for a cross-domain match today — this kernel genuinely
// cannot know the delivery outcome (that only exists once rust/host
// finishes the call), and rust/host doesn't build one either yet. A
// real, separate, documented gap — docs/HECKS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md's
// §8 has the fuller account of exactly what is and isn't proven about
// the live-delivery half.
