// Implements the `:optional` branch of `Runtime::Value::Coercion::SHAPES`
// (lib/hecks/runtime/value/coercion.rb) — `for_attribute`'s own
// first check, `return value if attribute.nil? || value.nil?`: an
// attribute that was never supplied arrives as Ruby's `nil`, unchanged —
// no value object ever gets a chance to run its own coercion or
// invariants on something that was never there.
//
// This kernel's `Value::Nil` is that same "not there" — built the
// identical way whether the source was a declared-`optional:` field left
// unset or a literal `nil` written in canonical text
// (`Resolver::NilLiteral`, `Expr::Nil`). Ruby draws no distinction
// between the two once evaluation actually starts (`nil` is `nil`,
// regardless of why), so neither does this file.
