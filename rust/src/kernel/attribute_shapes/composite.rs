// Implements the `:composite` branch of `Runtime::Value::Coercion::SHAPES`
// (lib/hecks/runtime/value/coercion.rb) — `for_attribute`'s
// `coerced =` line: the attribute's type names a declared value object,
// rebuilt recursively via `Value.build`. By the time an expression is
// being evaluated, that rebuilding has already happened (a generated
// struct's own `from_json`/mutation-application built the nested value
// ahead of time) — what this file owns is reading it back:
// `Resolver#fetch`'s own recursive per-segment walk (resolver.rb), one
// dotted-path component at a time, mirrored here as the `Field::Nested`
// half of every `Field` a dotted `Lookup` path can resolve to
// (`expr.rs`'s `lookup`, which calls straight into `step`/`finish`
// below rather than walking `Field` itself).
