// `read_model` construct; `report` is the language's own word for it, per
// `language/bluebook/syntax.bluebook`'s `was: "read_model"`) compiles down

// `read_model_def`/`emit_read_model_table`), and `run` below is the one
// hand-written interpreter every generated domain's own `READ_MODELS`

//
// Scope: exactly the subset `rust/project/read_models.rb`'s own
// `read_model_skip_reason` admits — a root aggregate fetched by its own
// reference id, plus one or more other aggregate heads found by scanning
// and matching a reference attribute back to an already-projected
// root/sibling row, plus (as of 2026-08-11) a declared `where`/`order_by`/
// `limit` on the one eligible many-side head (`filtered_head`, below), plus
// (as of Phase 10, equivalence-gap plan) that same head's own `offset` too —
// `IR::ReadModel#to_h` spells these four on the wire (`read_models.rb`'s
// own header has the full history). Still no `cursor`/
// `consistency`/`authorize`(TenantScope)/`nulls` beyond the
// default/`inspect_query` — real capabilities `Ports::Query::InMemory`/
// `TenantScope` implement that this generator still doesn't port, the same
// boundary `rust/project/queries.rb` already draws for a declared aggregate
// query, applied consistently here (`read_models.rb`'s own header has the
// full argument). A declared read model outside that subset simply has no
// row in the generated table at all — `kernel/cli.rs`'s own string-shaped
// "query" step refuses it the same clean way an unrouted verb or an
// unrecognized named query already does, never silently wrong.
//
// **Ground truth**: `Runtime::ReadModelInterpreter#project`
