// Extracted from `kernel/read_model.rs` (2026-08-11), not reinvented — this
// was `apply_declared_order`/`resolve_limit`/`order_key`/`compare_comparable`
// plus the tier-1-identity/tier-2-declared-order shape of `apply_filtered_
// head_options`, moved here unchanged so `kernel/named_query.rs` can call
// the same code for a declared aggregate query's own `order_by`/`limit`
// rather than growing a second, drifting copy. A single implementation
// is deliberate: once a second caller needs the identical sorting
// logic, keeping it in one place is what prevents the two from
// drifting apart.
//
// **Ground truth** — read directly, not assumed identical between callers:
//
//   `Runtime::QueryInterpreter#interpret` (lib/hecks/runtime/
//   query_interpreter.rb) — a declared aggregate query's own path:
//   `ordered = ordered(matched, declared.order_by, declared.null_semantics)`
//   then `capped = declared.limit ? ordered.first(resolve_query_value(
//   declared.limit.value, args).to_i) : ordered`. `ordered` itself is
//   `Ports::Query::Ordering.apply(records, order_by, null_semantics,
//   identity: ->(record) { record.id.to_s }) { |record| comparable(record
//   [field]) }` — id-string identity, exactly what `apply` below sorts by
//   in its own tier 1.
//
//   `Ports::Query::InMemory.execute` (lib/hecks/ports/query/
//   in_memory.rb) — the read model's own path (`ReadModelInterpreter#
//   project` calls this for the one eligible head): `matched = Ordering.
//   apply(matched, declared.order_by, declared.null_semantics, identity:
//   ->(record) { record.id.to_s }) { comparable(FieldPath.dig(record,
//   field)) }` then `matched.first(resolve(declared.limit.value, args).
//   to_i) if declared.limit`. Identical shape to `interpret` above —
//   same `Ordering.apply` call, same id-string identity block, same
//   `.first(N)` capping (`Vec::truncate` here is `Array#first`'s own
//   effect on an owned, already-sorted Vec: keep the first N, drop the
//   rest — the two are the same operation read from opposite ends).
//
// The one real structural difference between the two callers, confirmed by
// reading both interpreters rather than assumed: a declared query has no
// `filtered_head` concept at all — `interpret` orders/caps its own single
// matched set directly, because a query never chooses among several
// aggregate heads the way a read model's `report` block does. `read_model.
// rs`'s `apply_filtered_head_options` calls `apply` below on one head's
// own rows (the one `filtered_head` names); `named_query.rs`'s `run` calls
// it on the query's own (only) result set. Everything after that
// selection — identity sort, declared order, limit — is the same function,
// because Ruby's own `Ordering.apply`/`.first(N)` never knew or cared
// which caller it was serving either.
