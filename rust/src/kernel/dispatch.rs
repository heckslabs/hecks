// shape. What still has to be generated per command is deliberately
// small: identity derivation, the mutation-application closure (writing
// into a specific Rust struct's typed fields has no generic equivalent
// without reflection — Ruby's own genericity there comes from
// `instance[mutation.target] = value` on a dynamically-typed Hash-backed
// object, which Rust has no analogue for), and value-object invariant
// checks on the raw args (still called before `dispatch` even starts,
// mirroring `normalize_args` running before `hydrate`).
//
// NOT GENERIC HERE, BUT NOT MISSING EITHER: role checking (`check_role`,
// repository.rs, ADR 0019) and reference resolution (`check_reference`,
// repository.rs) both live in the GENERATED `registry.rs`/`merged.rs` call
// sites, not in this hand-written generic dispatch function — the one
// place with access to every OTHER aggregate's repo, not just this
// command's own, for reference checks, and the natural place to read a
// command's own declared `role:` for role checks. This function stays
// generic by construction: nothing here needs to change per command shape
// for either check to already be enforced.
