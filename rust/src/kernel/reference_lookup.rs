// Cross-aggregate dereference — `CommandRules::References#dereference`
// (lib/hecks/runtime/command_rules/references.rb), read directly.
// Ruby's own `given`/`ensures` clauses can name a hop through a declared
// `reference_to`/`belongs_to` field (`customer.status`, `account.customer.
// status`, `parent.account.customer.status`) — resolved by fetching the
// referenced record through `@registry.repository(domain, target)` and
// merging its own state (recursively dereferenced one hop further, up to
// `DEREFERENCE_DEPTH`) under the field's own stripped `_id`-less name,
// before the expression is ever evaluated. This file is that same
// resolution, ported: a real repository lookup, not a static-shaped
// approximation — a fetched record's own `Fielded::field` impl (already
// generated, already type-correct: `Value::Int`/`Float`/`Str` exactly as
// declared) answers every scalar the way it always has, the same
// mechanism `command`/`aggregate`-level fields already use, just reached
// one hop later.
//
// Why this is built outside `kernel::dispatch`/`dispatch_entity`, not
// **inside them**: resolving a reference needs `store` — every other
// aggregate's repo, not just this command's own — which structurally
// only exists at the router level (`registry.rs`'s generated
// `dispatch_by_name`, the same reason `resolve_references`'s own
// existence check lives there and not in commands.rb — see dispatch.rs's
// own header). Borrowing `store` immutably (for a lookup) and
// `store.<this aggregate>` mutably (for the dispatch call itself) in the
// same expression would be two overlapping borrows of the same value —
// so the router resolves every reference into owned `DerefNode` data
// first (a plain value, no longer borrowing `store` at all), and only
// then takes the mutable per-aggregate borrow `dispatch_by_name`'s own
// call already needed. `Store`'s generated `ReferenceLookup` impl is the
// one piece still reached through `store`, and only during that earlier,
// non-overlapping immutable phase.
