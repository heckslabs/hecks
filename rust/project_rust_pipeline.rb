# STAGE 8 (`/Users/christopheryoung/.claude/plans/sequential-petting-whale.md`)
# — the OPT-IN, all-Rust equivalent of `bin/project_rust`'s own default
# body: `hecks-parse resolve`/`hecks-parse chapter` for parsing,
# `hecks-codegen full` for codegen (aggregate files + registry.rs +
# mod.rs + merged.rs, per chapter), zero `Kernel.load` of any DOMAIN
# bluebook anywhere in this file. Selected ONLY when BOTH
# `HECKS_PARSER=rust` and `HECKS_CODEGEN=rust` are set — see
# `bin/project_rust`'s own header on why the two are paired rather than
# independently toggleable, and why this is opt-in rather than the new
# default (a deliberate, documented DEVIATION from the plan's own Stage
# 8 text: other concurrent sessions in this repo call `bin/project_rust`
# for unrelated work today, and flipping its default risks silently
# breaking them the moment anything about this new path is even
# slightly off in a case the corpus doesn't cover yet).
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS ALLOWED TO DO IN PLAIN RUBY, and why none of it
# violates "zero Kernel.load of any domain bluebook": reading a file's
# own `Hecks.bluebook "Name"` header line via `File.foreach` + regex
# (`header_chapter_name`, below) is TEXT SCANNING, not DSL execution —
# the exact same technique `spec/parser_parity_spec.rb`'s own
# `chapter_name_of` already uses, established precedent in this repo,
# not a shortcut invented here. Calling `Hecks::Framework.members`
# is a plain `Dir.glob` + naming lookup (`lib/hecks/framework.rb`'s
# own body) — no `Kernel.load` of anything. Reading
# `Hecks::Bluebook::MetaValidator::GRAMMAR_FILES` is the already-discovered,
# sorted folder contents. NONE of these boot, `instance_eval`, or otherwise
# execute a `.bluebook`/`.hecksagon` file's own DSL body — that only
# ever happens inside `hecks-parse`, a separate OS process, in Rust.
#
# THE `lineage` KEY, closed (was a named, deliberate gap; fixed below).
# The DEFAULT path's own `ir.json` sidecar carries a
# `lineage.capable_aggregates` list (`bin/project_rust`'s own
# `target_ir[:lineage] = ... Exporter.lineage(target_registry,
# target_domain_name)`), used ONLY by
# `rust/host/src/ir.rs::lineage_capable_aggregates` at RUNTIME (which
# aggregates get read/written through the era-partitioned lineage
# journal instead of the plain in-memory Store). `Exporter.lineage`
# itself (read it) needs exactly ONE fact per aggregate: which adapter
# NAME its sole authoritative `persisted_by` bind names
# (`Ports::Persistence::BindingPolicy.resolve`) — not the FULL open
# adapter-bind vocabulary (`deployed_to`, `uses_framework`, `role:`
# variants, `projected_by`, settings blocks). `derive_lineage`, below,
# gets that one fact the SAME way `header_chapter_name` already gets a
# chapter name — PLAIN TEXT SCANNING for one specific, narrow shape
# (`<Ns>::<Aggregate>.persisted_by("Adapter")`, no `role:`), never
# `Kernel.load`ing or interpreting the `.hecksagon` DSL as a whole. This
# does NOT reopen ADR 0023's own permanent open-vocabulary escape for
# `.hecksagon` adapter binds in the PARSER (`parse::hecksagon` still
# shape-matches and drops everything, unchanged) — it's a second, small,
# independent text scan living in THIS orchestration layer, the same
# tier `derive_append_optionals` already occupies, feeding one narrow,
# specific fact into a sidecar that needs it. Which adapters actually
# ARE lineage-capable is read the same way, off
# `lib/hecks/adapters/driven/*.rb`'s own `lineage_capable?`
# declarations — never hand-listed, so a second capable adapter needs no
# change here.
#
# ALSO NOT WRITTEN — `manifest.json` (the coverage manifest
# `bin/rust_coverage` reads): bookkeeping ABOUT `domain_generator.rb`'s
# own per-construct skip decisions, with "no bearing on whether the
# generated `.rs` source is correct" per that file's own header.
# Porting its ~15 call sites' worth of skip-reason tracking into
# `rust/codegen` would duplicate logic `commands.rs`/`queries.rs`/
# `read_models.rs`/etc. already compute for the REAL decision (whether
# to generate at all), not add new correctness coverage — judged
# legitimately Ruby-only debt for this stage, not silently skipped (see
# the stderr note `call` prints below, and `hecks-codegen full`'s own
# header in rust/codegen/src/main.rs).
