    # is the negative case that must stay `[]` — the exact regression the

    # `command[:references].nil?` ALONE (and the coincidental bare-name
    # matching `identity_components`, below, used to do) as the "does this
    # command build the OWNER record from scratch" test.
    #
    # `references.nil?` IS HONEST WHENEVER IT'S SET — a command that
    # genuinely declares `reference_to <its own owner>` (bare, no `as:`)
    # really does act on an existing one (`Compliance::AccountFreezeReview
    # .Clear`/`Governance::RoleTransition.Revoke`, both real, both keep
    # `references` non-nil and stay `false` here, unconditionally, on that
    # signal alone). What's dishonest is treating an ABSENT `references` as
    # proof of creation — a mutating meta-domain command like `Aggregate.
    # Attribute` declares no `reference_to` at all, not because it creates,
    # but because the owner it acts on is supplied entirely through ROUTING
    # (`to:`/`with:`), never as a declared argument — adding a bare
    # `reference_to Aggregate` purely to flip this heuristic was the
    # rejected direction (RESTART.md's own "Option 1": a fake self-
    # reference). So `references: nil` needs a SECOND, honest test.
    #
    # THAT TEST IS NOT COMPLETENESS. A creating command's generated Rust
    # struct Option-wraps EVERY scalar field regardless (`emit_record`'s own
    # header, types.rb) — an uncovered field just becomes `None`, which is
    # exactly how `Pizzas::Order.CreatePizza` (zero mutations, no `customer_
    # name` argument at all — `Order`'s fourth field) already generates
    # correctly. `Runtime::DependencyPlanning::Analyzer#complete_state?`
    # answers a DIFFERENT, narrower question for Ruby's own runtime (an
    # atomic-put OPTIMIZATION eligibility check) and disagrees with "creates"
    # on both sides — `CardPayment.Authorize` is complete_state?-false (its
    # own identity field, `authorisation`, is never a `:set` target) yet
    # unquestionably creates a fresh `CardPayment`; `Aggregate.Lifecycle`
    # IS complete_state?-true-shaped (it `:set`s two real fields) yet acts on
    # an existing `Aggregate` — completeness alone cannot tell these apart.
    #
    # THE HONEST TEST: with `references: nil` already narrowing to "no
    # explicit reference at all," a command creates the owner when it
    # supplies (via a `:set` mutation OR — `emit_command`'s own
    # `record_fields`, commands.rb — a same-named argument, copied straight
    # across with NO mutation required) at least one of the owner's own
    # REQUIRED (non-list, non-optional) fields. `Order.CreatePizza` supplies
    # `name`/`pizza` this way (both required) — that's real evidence of
    # building a genuinely new record. `Aggregate.Attribute`/`Aggregate.
    # Lifecycle` supply nothing of the kind: the first's every argument is
    # claimed by its own `append`, the second touches only `state_field`/
    # `state_start`, both `optional: true` — attaching a fact to a record
    # that must already exist is exactly what "nothing required is ever
    # newly supplied" looks like. A `:set`/bare-matched argument already
    # claimed by an APPEND (`ValueObject.Member`'s own `position`, feeding
    # the appended MEMBER's `position`, never `ValueObject`'s own
    # unrelated, declaration-order field of the same name) is excluded from
    # counting as such evidence — the exact bare-name coincidence this

    # can't be looked up there and isn't `Option`-wrapped on the record the

    # "sold"` is a real, redundant instance of this (redundant with the
    # transition's own advance, harmless, same pattern as `Account.Open`'s
    # redundant `sets` on an already-implicit creation attribute).
    # THE IDENTITY IS THE JOIN OF ITS PARTS (Naming::IDENTITY_JOIN is ":",
    # read directly) — one component per `identified_by` entry, each
    # resolved the same way `Runtime::Identity.from` resolves it: a
    # component whose HEAD names a declared command attribute walks into
    # that argument's own field (a dotted `rest` walks further into it —
    # `box_number.value`, a value-object-typed argument); a component
    # whose head is NOT a declared attribute (`owner_id` — "never a
    # declared attribute," per `language/bluebook/behavior.bluebook`'s own
    # comment) isn't in the command's own typed `XArgs` struct at all —
    # it's an addressing key allowed straight through `refuse_unknown_
    # arguments`'s allowlist the same way `id:` already is, so it never
    # became a struct field; the generated dispatch function instead takes
    # it as its own extra parameter, the same shape an acting command's
    # caller-supplied `id: &str` already has. `head:` (this branch only)
    # is that same fact one level RAWER than `expr`/`param` — the bare
    # JSON key `registry.rb`'s own router reads it off `args_json` under,
    # once it stops merely declaring the parameter and starts actually
    # supplying it.
    #
    # THE HEAD CHECK GOVERNS BOTH SHAPES, NOT JUST THE BARE ONE — this used
    # to branch on `rest.any?` FIRST, so any dotted path unconditionally
    # read `args.<head>.<rest>`, assuming the head was always one of this
    # command's OWN declared attributes. True for every ordinary domain's
    # creating command until the self-hosted meta-grammar's own
    # owner-mutating commands (`Aggregate.Identify` et al.) exercised the
    # one combination nothing else in the corpus had: a DOTTED identity
    # component (`name.value`, the meta-Aggregate's own name being a
    # single-field value object) whose head belongs to the OWNER being
    # mutated, not to the command's own args — `IdentifyArgs` has only
    # `path`, so `args.name` doesn't exist, and `cargo build` refused it.
    # The head-declared? check now gates BOTH shapes: undeclared means
    # external regardless of whether the path was dotted, because a value
    # supplied from outside args is already the resolved scalar the caller
    # read off the owner's own state — there is no `.value` left to walk.
    #
    # "DECLARED" MEANS a genuine `:set` mutation TARGETS this head — not
    # merely "some command attribute happens to share the head's name"
    # (the bare-name check this used to be). A dozen meta-domain "attach
    # one child to the owner" commands (`Aggregate.Attribute` et al.) each
    # declare an attribute coincidentally named the same as one of their
    # OWNER's identity components (both have a field called `name`) while
    # never setting the owner's own field at all — their one mutation
    # APPENDS that attribute into a list, sourced by that argument, which
    # is an entirely different thing from minting the owner's own id. See
    # `creates_owner?`'s own header (this file) for the full story; this
