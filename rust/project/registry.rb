    # ── THE JSON COMMAND ROUTER — `dispatch_by_name`'s own per-domain
    # table, generated once (domain_generator.rb calls this last, after
    # every aggregate's own file is written). One `Store` field per
    # generated aggregate — an `InMemoryRepository<T>`, the only
    # `Repository` impl this kernel ships (kernel/repository.rs) — and one
    # match arm per generated command (`command_skip_reason`'s survivors
    # only; a skipped command was never given a `dispatch_*` function to
    # route to either). `kernel/cli.rs` is the one caller: it knows verbs
    # and JSON, nothing domain-specific: this table is the whole bridge.
    #
    # `aggregates` is `[{name:, mod:, record:, commands: [{verb:, fn:,
    # args_struct:, creates:, reference_checks:, role:}], entity_commands:
    # [{verb:, entity_record:, fn:, args_struct:, reference_checks:,
    # role:}]}]` — accumulated by domain_generator.rb while it walks the
    # real IR, not re-derived here. `reference_checks` is `[{field:,
    # optional:, target_mod:, target_name:, heads:}]` (`domain_generator.
    # rb`'s own `reference_checks` helper) — `CommandRules::References
    # #resolve_references`'s per-attribute walk, done at codegen time
    # instead of dispatch time. `role:` is the command's own declared
    # role string, or `nil` (most commands declare none) — `Command
    # #role`, exported verbatim.
    #
    # Both emitted HERE, in the router, rather than inside each command's
    # own `dispatch_*` function (commands.rb):
    #   - `resolve_references` needs `store` — every OTHER aggregate's
    #     repo, not just this command's own — which only exists at this
    #     level, the same way Ruby's own version reaches through
    #     `@registry.repository(domain, target)` rather than anything
    #     local to one command.
    #   - `refuse_role_mismatch` needs the CALLER's role, which arrives
    #     as this router's own `caller_role` parameter (`cli.rs`'s own
    #     per-step `role:` key) — commands.rb's generated functions have
    #     no equivalent parameter and shouldn't grow one just for this.
    # Emitted right after `from_json` succeeds and before the real
    # dispatch call, matching Ruby's own `DISPATCH_ORDER`: `refuse_role_
    # mismatch` then `resolve_references` run in that order, both after
    # argument normalization/coercion and strictly before `hydrate`/
    # `enforce_givens` — verified live: a dangling reference (0016's own
    # investigation) or a role mismatch is refused before the command's
    # OWN `given`s are even consulted.
    # `command_name` is the SHORT name (`command.hecks_name` — "Open",
    # not the qualified verb "Banking::Account.Open") — confirmed against
    # Ruby's own live wording: `"Open refused — role: Branch clerk, and
    # the caller stated Wrong Role"`.
