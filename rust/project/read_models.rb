    # ── READ MODEL CODEGEN — the subset of a declared `report "X" do
    # ... end` block (ReadModel — the `read_model` construct;
    # `report` is the language's own word for it, per syntax.bluebook's
    # `was: "read_model"`) expressible as: a ROOT aggregate fetched by
    # its own reference id, plus one or more OTHER aggregate heads found
    # by scanning and matching a REFERENCE FIELD back to an
    # already-projected root/sibling row, PLUS (as of 2026-08-11) a
    # declared `where`/`order_by`/`limit` on the ONE eligible many-side
    # head. Exactly `kernel/repository.rs`'s existing `AggregateScan`/
    # `filter_entries` scan primitive (`AggregateScan::scan`/
    # `filter_entries`, both reused directly — no new kernel scanning or
    # filtering primitive was needed) plus a hand-written matcher and
    # sorter (`kernel/read_model.rs`) that walks it the same "compile
    # shapes, interpret behavior" way `named_query.rs` already walks a
    # generated `QUERIES` table.
    #
    # GROUND TRUTH: `Runtime::ReadModelInterpreter#project`
    # (lib/hecks/runtime/read_model_interpreter.rb), read directly —
    # resolve the root by id, walk every declared head ROOT-FIRST for
    # COMPUTATION regardless of `include` order (a real, once-live bug:
    # a many-side head declared before its own root silently matched
    # against an empty `projected` and came back too small — see
    # `kernel/read_model.rs`'s own header for the full citation), match
    # every OTHER head's own reference attributes against whichever
    # heads are already in `projected` (applying `Ports::Query::InMemory.
    # execute` to the ONE eligible head's own rows the moment they're
    # computed, before they join `projected` — `model.filtered_head_name`
    # says which one), then materialize in DECLARED order for the OUTPUT
    # even though the computation above needed root-first.
    #
    # THE WIRE FORMAT USED TO STRUCTURALLY EXCLUDE where/order_by/limit —
    # `ReadModel#to_h` never serialized them at all, so there was no
    # data here to bake a filter/sort/cap from no matter how this
    # generator was written. That changed 2026-08-11: `ReadModel#to_h`
    # now spells `wheres`/`order_by`/`limit` explicitly, the same
    # mechanism `Query#to_h` already used (`lib/hecks/bluebook/
    # ir/read_model.rb`'s own comment has the full history) — so this
    # generator now reads real filter/sort/cap data off the canonical
    # `ir.json` for the first time, and does something with it, for the
    # ONE eligible head `ReadModel#filtered_head_name` already names
    # (`seal_query_options`'s own "options apply to a single collection"
    # rule — read directly in `lib/hecks/bluebook/dsl/
    # read_model_builder.rb` — means there is never ambiguity about which
    # head where/order_by/limit apply to; this generator trusts that
    # invariant the same way the Ruby interpreter does, rather than
    # re-deriving or re-checking it).
    #
    # WHAT THIS STILL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER, AND WHY — read together
    # with `read_model_skip_reason` below:
    #
    #   `cursor`/`consistency`/
    #   `inspection` — real
    #   capabilities `Ports::Query::InMemory`/`Ports::Query::Ordering`/
    #   `TenantScope` implement that this generator does not port, the
    #   SAME boundary `queries.rb` already draws for a declared AGGREGATE
    #   query's own `order_by`/`limit`/etc (that file's own header),
    #   applied consistently here now that where/order_by/limit
    #   themselves have crossed over. `freshness`/`use_index` are NOT in
    #   this list — see `READ_MODEL_BARE_KEYS` below for why tolerating
    #   them is honest, not a shortcut. `offset`/`null_semantics`/
    #   `authorization` used to be in this list too — Phase 10
    #   (equivalence-gap plan) ported all three, reusing `queries.rb`'s own
    #   `declared_offset_skip_reason`/`emit_query_order_by`'s own
    #   `null_semantics_variant`/`declared_authorization_skip_reason`
    #   directly (no read-model-specific content check needed for any of
    #   them — the exact same shapes/fallback rules apply whether the
    #   declaring construct was a Query or a ReadModel). `authorization`
    #   specifically has no real corpus read model to prove it against
    #   today (unlike the AGGREGATE-query port, which closed a real,
    #   previously-refused `Banking::SafeDepositBox.Rented`) — ADR 0041
    #   has the honest accounting of why it was ported anyway (the
    #   mechanism is byte-identical to the already-proven query path, not
    #   new design) and what's verified against instead (a purpose-built
    #   fixture).
    #
    #   A `where`/`order_by` whose own field this generator can't safely
    #   express — a hop through a reference, an entity-scoped field, a
    #   `list_of` field, a multi-member non-numeric value object, or (for
    #   `where` specifically) a LITERAL comparator value whose true JSON
    #   type can't be recovered from the exported IR. Reuses `queries.rb`'s
    #   own `query_field_kind`/`query_where_skip_reason` wholesale, against
    #   the ELIGIBLE HEAD's own aggregate rather than the read model's root
    #   — the identical reasoning, just aimed at a different aggregate (see
    #   `read_model_options_content_skip_reason` below).
    #
    #   `TenantScope` (an `authorize policy, tenant: :field` boundary) —
    #   covered by the options-content check above (a declared `authorize`
    #   survives into `extra_options_to_h`, so any read model declaring one
    #   is already excluded). No real corpus read model declares one today
    #   (confirmed by reading all three declarations directly — see
    #   `bin/rust_coverage`'s own ALLOWLIST entry for this generator).
    #
    #   Adapter-native `query_read_model` pushdown (Postgres/SQL) — this
    #   kernel has no SQL adapter at all, the same structural N/A
    #   `queries.rb`'s own header and the era/lineage gap already
    #   establish for this codebase; `kernel/read_model.rs`'s in-process
    #   loop is the only path, matching Ruby's own in-process fallback
    #   (`ReadModelInterpreter#project`'s `unless rootless ||
    #   model.group_by.any?` early-return never fires for anything this
    #   generator admits, since none of it is rootless or group_by'd
    #   either — see below). This is also why tolerating `freshness`/
    #   `use_index` is honest rather than a shortcut: neither is ever READ
    #   by the in-memory interpreter path this kernel matches — both exist
    #   solely to steer an adapter's OWN native pushdown, which is
    #   structurally absent here regardless.
    #
    #   `rootless` read models and `group_by` — features that exist on
    #   this codebase's OWN `main` branch (a later `ReadModelInterpreter`
    #   than the one this branch carries), not on `feat/rust-projection`
    #   at all: THIS branch's `ReadModel` has no `reference_target`-
    #   nilable/`group_by` concept for a bluebook author to even declare,
    #   so there is structurally nothing here to skip — noted for a
    #   future reader diffing this generator against a newer
    #   `read_model_interpreter.rb`, not a corner this generator cuts
    #   today.
    #
    #   `freshness`/`use_index` ARE tolerated (not disqualifying) — the
    #   only two of the eight generic options that are. Neither is ever
    #   read by `ReadModelInterpreter#project`'s in-memory path (see the
    #   pushdown paragraph above), so their presence changes nothing about
    #   what this generator can honestly compute; refusing on them anyway
    #   would be refusing a real corpus read model (`Banking::
    #   ComplianceDashboard` declares both) for a reason that has no
    #   bearing on correctness.
    # `group_by` is IN this list — merged in from `main`'s own rootless-
    # read-model work (see the long note above), which made `
    # ReadModel#to_h` spell `group_by:` UNCONDITIONALLY, the same
    # "always spell the key" move `wheres`/`order_by`/`limit` already
    # went through (this file's own header, above). So `group_by`'s mere
    # PRESENCE as a key is no longer a usable disqualifying signal — every
    # read model carries it now, `[]` when nothing was declared — and it
    # has to be checked by VALUE instead, explicitly, right below.
