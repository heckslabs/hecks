    # ── THIS COMMAND'S OWN DECLARED ATTRIBUTE NAMES (R1,
    # docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md) — `orchestrate.rs`'s own
    # `split_routed_args` needs this to build a reaction-triggered
    # dispatch's `with:` facts the SAME way `ReactionInvocation.
    # command_facts` does on the Ruby side: `args.slice(*declared)`,
    # dropping anything the target command doesn't itself declare as an
    # attribute — an identity/reference/correlation key a policy or
    # process manager's own `with:` mapping resolved (`reference: :reference`
    # forwarding a Transfer's own reference onto its saga-dispatched
    # Account::Debit/Credit legs, the corpus's real, live example) but
    # the TARGET command never declared stays OFF that command's own
    # event payload — exactly like a direct, hand-written dispatch of the
    # same command never carries it either. Previously `split_routed_
    # args` only ever REMOVED the one key it promoted into `to:`,
    # leaving every OTHER undeclared key (like a forwarded `reference:`)
    # sitting in `with:` unfiltered, which is what let it leak all the
    # way into the persisted event (`Json::overlay`'s own `patch` merge
    # never touches a key it doesn't declare, so `base`'s copy — this
    # exact leaked key — survived the merge untouched).
    #
    # Built the same way `emit_creates_table` is: one arm per verb, both
    # `aggregate[:commands]` and `aggregate[:entity_commands]` — an
    # entity command's own declared attributes are exactly as real a
    # constraint on its facts as an aggregate command's.
    #
    # NARROWER THAN Ruby's OWN gate, on purpose: this only ever runs
    # inside `split_routed_args`, itself only ever reached from a
    # POLICY/PROCESS-MANAGER-triggered dispatch (`react_policies`/
    # `deliver_saga_dispatch`'s own `build_dispatch_args`) — a direct,
    # externally-dispatched command's own facts are never touched by
    # this table at all, matching Ruby's own split (`ReactionInvocation
    # .build`'s `command_facts` slice applies to a REACTION's own
    # explicit projection, never to `Dispatcher#dispatch`'s plain
    # external args).
