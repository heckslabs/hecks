    # `PortOperation` has no `references`/`givens`/`mutations`/`ensures`
    # at all (its own header: "a port is the anti-corruption boundary that
    # turns an external call into a fact... not a second place business
    # rules live") — so `command_skip_reason`'s own long list of ungenerable
    # SHAPES mostly does not apply here; the one real one that still can:
    # an attribute type this domain's own aggregate-level check never
    # resolved a Rust type for (a port introducing a value object no OTHER
    # attribute anywhere in this aggregate already forced into existence —
    # no real operation in this corpus does that; flagged rather than
    # silently assumed impossible). A list attribute carrying `admits:`/
    # `pattern:` used to be refused here too (`constraint_list_problems`) —
    # removed (docs/decisions/0051): confirmed against Ruby's real
    # dispatch pipeline that neither is ever enforced on a list attribute
    # regardless, so refusing to generate the operation at all was MORE
    # restrictive than Ruby, not a real gap to guard.
    #
    # NO LONGER REQUIRES A `reference_to <owner>` ATTRIBUTE — routing
    # separation (`to:`/`with:`) supplies the receiver identity externally
    # now, the same way an acting COMMAND's own identity does
    # (`registry.rb`'s `CommandInvocation#split_aggregate_receiver`), so a
    # self-reference on the operation is a migration-era spelling of its
    # receiver at most, never a requirement. `Pizzas::Order.PaymentGateway.
    # Receive` — the corpus's one live port operation — declares no such
    # reference at all and used to be skipped here as a codegen bug; it
    # generates for real now.

    # ── ONE emitter per port operation — the args struct plus a pure
    # dispatch function with no repo, no Hydrate, no mutation record: an
    # operation neither hydrates nor saves an aggregate instance
    # (`PortOperationInterpreter#call`'s own shorter `DISPATCH_ORDER`,
    # ported the same way `emit_entity_command` ports `EntityInterpreter
    # #call`'s). `registry.rb`'s own `emit_reference_check` runs BEFORE
    # this function is even called (the same "needs `store`, only exists
    # at the router level" reason a command's own reference checks do,
    # `reactions.rb`'s header) — by the time control reaches here, the
    # referenced aggregate is already known to exist, so this only builds
    # the event(s) the operation's own `emits` names, addressed by
    # `receiver_id` — the router's own resolved receiver identity
    # (`CommandInvocation#split_aggregate_receiver`, registry.rb), passed
    # in as this function's own first parameter now rather than read off a
    # declared attribute. The payload this function's own events carry is
    # a placeholder (`Json::Null`) — `registry.rb`'s generated call site
    # wraps the return with the SAME `stamp_payload(events, &payload)` a
    # command's own dispatch call already does, which REPLACES it with the
    # router's real, raw facts — so this function never needs to build a
    # correct payload itself, only correct `name`/`aggregate`/`id`.
    #
    # A SELF-REFERENCE ATTRIBUTE (`reference_to <owner>`, the migration-era
    # spelling of this same receiver) is EXCLUDED from the generated args
    # struct/JSON codec/event payload entirely — it names no external fact
    # once routing supplies the receiver, the same reason `registry.rb`'s
    # `emit_registry` strips it from `facts_json` via `split_aggregate_
    # receiver`'s own `legacy_receiver_field` when one is present.
