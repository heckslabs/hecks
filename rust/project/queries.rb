    # ── NAMED QUERY CODEGEN — the subset of a declared `query "X" do
    # ... end` block expressible as one or more field-comparator
    # conditions, ANDed together, against a single aggregate's OWN
    # attributes, PLUS (as of 2026-08-11) that same result set's own
    # declared `order_by`/`limit`: exactly `kernel/repository.rs`'s
    # existing `filter_entries`/`AggregateScan` machinery for the where
    # clauses, chained into `kernel/query_ordering.rs`'s `apply` for the
    # order/cap — the SAME sort/limit tail `read_models.rb` already ported
    # for a read model's own eligible head (that module's own header has
    # the full argument for why this was reuse, not new invention, once it
    # existed). `query_skip_reason` is the single gate every other
    # function here answers to; `query_conditions` only ever runs once a
    # query has already passed it.
    #
    # WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER, and why — read together with
    # `query_where_skip_reason`/`declared_order_by_skip_reason`/
    # `declared_offset_skip_reason`/`declared_limit_skip_reason` below:
    #
    #   cursor / consistency / freshness /
    #   inspection / use_index — every one of these is a real capability
    #   `Ports::Query::InMemory`/`TenantScope` implements and this
    #   generator does not attempt to port, the SAME boundary
    #   `read_models.rb` draws for a declared read model's own eligible
    #   head (that file's own header has the full argument — including WHY
    #   freshness/use_index are tolerated there and NOT here: this
    #   generator hasn't been given the same "neither is ever read by the
    #   in-memory interpreter path" case-by-case audit for the AGGREGATE-
    #   query side of that argument, so it stays conservative rather than
    #   assume the read-model finding transfers unexamined). `offset`/
    #   `null_semantics`/`authorization` used to be in this list too —
    #   Phase 10 (equivalence-gap plan) ported all three for real: `offset`
    #   the identical Literal/Arg shape `limit` already had
    #   (`declared_offset_skip_reason`/`emit_query_offset` below — read
    #   models gained it too, a separate round); `null_semantics` a
    #   top-level `nulls :first`/`:last` override folded straight into the
    #   generated `OrderBy` struct (`query_ordering::NullsMode` — that
    #   type's own header has the full argument for why an unrecognized/
    #   absent mode safely falls back to the pre-existing direction-
    #   dependent default rather than needing a refusal case at all);
    #   `authorization` (TenantScope) a synthetic `field == args[tenant]`
    #   condition baked into `conditions` at codegen time PLUS an explicit
    #   presence check on the wire arg (`named_query::TenantAuth` —
    #   `declared_authorization_skip_reason`/`emit_query_authorization`
    #   below have the full argument, including why `authorize policy`
    #   with no `tenant:` is a genuine no-op rather than a gap; read models
    #   still refuse a declared `authorize` outright, unchanged — this is
    #   a QUERY-only port, no real corpus read model to prove it against).
    #
    #   an order_by field that doesn't reduce to a plain JSON string or
    #   number (a hop, an entity-scoped field, a list_of field, a
    #   multi-member non-numeric value object) — `declared_order_by_skip_
    #   reason` below, reusing `query_field_kind` the identical way
    #   `read_models.rb`'s own `read_model_order_by_skip_reason` (now
    #   moved here and renamed — see that function's own comment) already
    #   did.
    #
    #   a limit whose own declared value isn't a literal integer or a
    #   caller-bound Symbol arg — `declared_limit_skip_reason` below, same
    #   move-and-rename.
    #
    #   a where clause hopping through a reference (`customer.status`) —
    #   cross-aggregate joins are `read_model` territory, a different,
    #   still-wholly-ungenerated IR construct (domain_generator.rb's own
    #   header). Detected here as a side effect of `query_field_kind`
    #   simply failing to resolve the field's head against this
    #   aggregate's own declared attributes/lifecycle field: a hop's own
    #   head names an ACCESSOR alias (`Naming.reference_hop`), never the
    #   attribute's real storage name, so it never matches.
    #
    #   a LITERAL (non-Symbol) where value whose true JSON type this
    #   generator cannot recover. `QuerySpecification::Common::
    #   WhereClause#to_h` — the only shape `bin/ir`'s exported IR (what
    #   this generator actually reads) ever carries a where clause's own
    #   value AS — renders EVERY literal through `QuerySpecification.
    #   render_value`, which is `value.to_s` for anything that isn't a
    #   Symbol: an Integer literal `1000` and a String literal `"1000"`
    #   are already indistinguishable by the time this file ever sees
    #   them. `gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte` need real Json::Num-vs-Json::Str
    #   fidelity to mean anything at all (query_comparators.rs's own
    #   `ordered?` gate), so a literal comparator value is never eligible
    #   there. `eq`/`ne` only need that fidelity when the TARGET field
    #   itself could ever reduce to something other than a string
    #   (`Ports::Query::InMemory#comparable`'s own numeric-member-wins,
    #   else-single-member-collapses rule) — `query_field_kind` walks the
    #   SAME declared-shape collapse, so a literal `eq`/`ne` is only
    #   generated when it lands on a field that's provably string-shaped.
    #   `in`/`contains` are the one pair of comparators exempt from this
    #   entirely: both stringify their OWN argument unconditionally in
    #   Ruby (`Ports::Query::InMemory#members`/`#contains?`, read
    #   directly — `value.to_s.split(",")`/`want.to_s`, neither gated on
    #   the value's real type), so a rendered-string literal is exactly
    #   as correct there as whatever the original value really was.
    #
    # A Symbol-valued where (`where(actor_id: :actor_id)`) is exempt from
    # all of the literal-safety reasoning above: it resolves against
    # THIS call's own wire `args` at dispatch time (kernel/named_query.rs),
    # which carries its real JSON type already — no IR round trip to lose
    # it through.
