module RustProjection
  # THE LOADER/RENDERER for rust/src/exemplar/*.rs — real, `cargo
  # test`-checked Rust that stands in for what used to be hand-interpolated
  # strings scattered across this directory's emit_* functions. See the
  # exemplar-driven-codegen plan this was built from for the full design;
  # in short: every shape a generator emits is written ONCE, for real, as
  # a complete compiling Rust item in rust/src/exemplar/*.rs, fenced with
  # `// TMPL:<id> BEGIN` / `// TMPL:<id> END` comments. This module slices
  # those fences out and substitutes real domain names for the fixed
  # `Tmpl`/`tmpl_`/`TMPL_` placeholder vocabulary the exemplar uses
  # throughout — never a structural rewrite, only identifier-for-identifier
  # (or whole-literal-for-whole-literal) substitution, which is what lets a
  # substitution never produce invalid syntax: the exemplar was already
  # valid with the placeholder in that exact position.
  #
  # WHAT VARIES SHAPE TO SHAPE ISN'T INVENTED HERE, EITHER: `lib/hecks/
  # language/bluebook/shape.bluebook`'s own `ShapeField` already names, once
  # for the whole language, the axes a real attribute's shape can vary
  # along (`list`, `optional`, `pattern`, `admits`). The exemplar shapes
  # under rust/src/exemplar/{types,fielded,json,mutations}.rs branch on
  # exactly those same axes — each shape's own header says which
  # `ShapeField` attribute it's the Rust reading of, rather than
  # re-deriving the taxonomy independently.
  module Exemplar
    # ANY marker this vocabulary can produce — checked both ways: every
    # `subs` key a caller supplies must appear in the shape's raw text
    # (else the caller drifted from what the exemplar actually declares),
    # and after substitution NOTHING matching this pattern may remain
    # (else the caller forgot a placeholder, and literal `TmplType` text
    # would otherwise leak into real generated output). One regex covers
    # both identifier-shaped placeholders (`TmplType`, `tmpl_field`,
    # `TMPL_TABLE`) and literal-content placeholders (`"tmpl_admits_name"`,
    # `["tmpl_member_a", "tmpl_member_b"]`) — every literal placeholder
    # this file ever writes embeds a `tmpl_`/`Tmpl`/`TMPL_` token
    # somewhere inside it for exactly this reason.

      # Fixed-arity rendering: `subs` is a Hash of marker-string =>
      # replacement-text. Every marker is a literal substring match (never
      # a regex) — deliberately: a placeholder like `["tmpl_member_a",
      # "tmpl_member_b"]` isn't identifier-shaped, and plain substring
      # replacement is exactly as safe as regex here BECAUSE this file
      # controls 100% of what markers exist in the exemplar. Longer
      # markers substitute first so one marker can never accidentally eat
      # a piece of another (`tmpl_field` vs a hypothetical
      # `tmpl_field_extra`, say).
      #
      # `gsub(marker, value)` — the two-arg form — is a trap here: Ruby
      # interprets backslash sequences (`\\`, `\1`, ...) INSIDE the
      # replacement string even when `marker` is a plain String, not a
      # Regexp. A pattern's `.inspect`ed source (`"^...\\.[^@ ]+$"`, a
      # real double backslash before the dot) silently collapsed to a
      # single backslash through this path — found live, diffing
      # generated output against the pre-exemplar checked-in files. The
      # block form never interprets its return value; every substitution
      # here uses it for exactly that reason.
