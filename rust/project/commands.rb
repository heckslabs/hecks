    # docs/decisions/0043/0051 found, by tracing `Runtime::
    # CommandInterpreter`'s full dispatch pipeline exhaustively and
    # confirming live against Ruby's real interpreter, that a bare
    # command-attribute's OWN `pattern:` is NEVER enforced by Ruby: `Value#
    # check_patterns` fires only from `build`, which fires only when the
    # attribute's type resolves to an actual value object and gets
    # rebuilt — a usage-level `pattern:` on a scalar command argument has
    # no VO to build at all, so it is silently accepted, whether or not
    # that argument is ever a mutation source. Generating a check here
    # made Rust STRICTER than Ruby (the opposite direction from every
    # other gap this plan closed) — removed rather than kept, per ADR
    # 0010 (Ruby is the reference implementation; Rust conforms to it,
    # not the other way around). `admits:` at this SAME door is genuinely
    # different: it fires unconditionally from `normalize_args`'s own
    # `admit_declared_set` call, for every declared argument present in
    # the payload, regardless of mutation usage — confirmed enforced,
    # kept exactly as it was.
    #
    # `attr[:list]` attributes are skipped for the `admits:` check too —
    # `admit_declared_set` is reached only via `Value.for_attribute`'s
    # SCALAR branch (a list attribute returns early into
    # `hydrate_entity_list` instead, before ever reaching it) — so a list
