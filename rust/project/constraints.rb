    # `admits:`/`pattern:` (`attribute_collector.rb`'s own keyword args) sit
    # on the SAME `Attribute` shape wherever `attribute()` is called —
    # a value object's own field (`EmailAddress.address, pattern: ...`) or
    # an aggregate/command's own usage-level attribute (`ExternalTransfer`'s
    # `direction, MovementDirection, admits: "Account::LedgerDirection"`).
    # Ruby checks BOTH doors (`admission.rb`'s own `check_admitted`/
    # `check_patterns`, called from `Value.build`, and `admit_declared_set`,
    # called from `coerce_declared_arguments`) — this file is the shared
    # half both `types.rb` (the value-object door) and `commands.rb` (the
    # command/entity-command-argument door) call into.

    # The scalar `admitted_scalar`/`check_patterns` actually operate on —
    # bare already if the attribute's own declared type IS the scalar
    # (`String`), or the sole field of a single-field value object (the
    # "one-field holder" `admission.rb`'s own comment names). `nil` for
    # anything else (a multi-field VO, a closed-set VO with more than one
    # discriminant) — not a shape either door can unwrap either.

    # An OPTIONAL attribute is `Option<T>` in the struct, not `T` — the two

    # (`self.description`) whether or not `attr[:optional]` held, which
    # compiled fine for every attribute nobody had yet paired `optional:`
    # with `admits:`/`pattern:` and broke the moment one was (a plain
    # `Option<String>` where `pattern::matches`'s own signature wants
    # `&str`). Ruby's own two doors (`admission.rb#admit_declared_set`,
    # `coercion.rb#check_patterns`) both skip the check outright on `nil`
    # — so this resolves a SCALAR EXPRESSION TO CHECK, only when the
    # attribute is required, or a REBINDING TARGET (the source `Option`
    # expression the caller must `if let Some(...)` around) when it's
    # not — never both, and the caller (`wrap_if_optional`, below) is
