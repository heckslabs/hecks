//! `hecks-build` — Stage 8 CAPSTONE (a follow-up to
//! `/Users/christopheryoung/.claude/plans/sequential-petting-whale.md`,
//! continuing directly from that plan's own Stage 8, which landed as
//! `rust/project_rust_pipeline.rb` — an all-Rust PARSE+CODEGEN pipeline
//! that was still itself a Ruby process, opt-in behind
//! `HECKS_PARSER=rust HECKS_CODEGEN=rust bin/project_rust <domain>`).
//!
//! THIS CRATE DOES THE SAME JOB, but is itself a compiled Rust binary —
//! a domain's `.bluebook` source goes from disk to a compiled artifact
//! with NO Ruby process involved anywhere in the chain, not even for
//! orchestration. `rust/project_rust_pipeline.rb`'s own header is the
//! literal specification this crate ports (`src/pipeline.rs` mirrors its
//! `RustProjectPipeline.call` body step for step); read that file's own
//! extensive comments for the full reasoning behind each step, which
//! this crate deliberately does NOT re-derive, only re-implements.
//!
//! ARCHITECTURE (decided, not re-litigated here): this crate calls the
//! EXISTING `hecks-parse` (`rust/parser/`) and `hecks-codegen`
//! (`rust/codegen/`) binaries as SUBPROCESSES
//! (`std::process::Command`, via `src/subprocess.rs`) — the same way
//! `rust/project_rust_pipeline.rb` shells out to them via
//! `Open3.capture3`/`system` today. Neither sibling crate is
//! restructured into a library or merged into this one: both stay
//! exactly as they are, proven byte-exact against Ruby's own reference
//! implementation by `spec/parser_parity_spec.rb`/`spec/codegen_parity_
//! spec.rb`, and untouched by this work (`git diff --stat` against this
//! crate's own base commit is scoped to `rust/build/` and new spec
//! files only).
//!
//! THE ONE GENUINELY NEW PIECE OF LOGIC (beyond pure orchestration):
//! `src/optional_pass.rs`, a Rust port of `RustProjection::Projector.
//! mark_append_optional_fields!` (`rust/project/mutations.rb`) — see
//! that module's own header for the full derivation and how it's
//! verified.
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//!   hecks-build <domain> [--wasm] [--no-build]
//!
//! `<domain>` is a path to a domain's own directory (e.g.
//! `examples/pizzas`, `examples/banking`), the same argument shape
//! `bin/project_rust <domain>` already takes — resolved relative to the
//! CURRENT DIRECTORY, exactly like the Ruby original (this crate's own
//! `src/root.rs` separately locates the hecks REPO root, by walking
//! up from the current directory looking for `hecks.gemspec`, for
//! everything else it needs: `rust/parser`, `rust/codegen`, `rust/src/
//! generated`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, `lib/hecks/framework/bluebook`,
//! `lib/hecks/language/bluebook`).
//!
//! `--wasm` additionally cross-compiles for `wasm32-wasip1` (mirroring
//! `bin/project_wasm`'s own invocation) once the native build succeeds.
//! `--no-build` skips BOTH `cargo build` steps for the domain's own
//! compiled artifact, generating source only — useful for fast,
//! repeated differential verification against the existing Ruby
//! pipelines, which never build the domain artifact themselves either.
//! Native `cargo build --release` runs by default (no flag needed): the
//! whole point of this crate over the Ruby-orchestrated opt-in path is
//! that a plain `hecks-build <domain>` is genuinely end-to-end, bluebook
//! in, compiled binary out, one command.
