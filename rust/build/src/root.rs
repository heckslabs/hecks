//! Locating the repo root — the one piece of bookkeeping
//! `rust/project_rust_pipeline.rb` gets for free (`ROOT = File.expand_path
//! ("..", __dir__)`, resolved off the script's own file path, independent
//! of whatever directory it was invoked from) that a compiled binary has
//! to do differently: `std::env::current_exe()` would tie this crate to
//! its own build output layout (`rust/build/target/{debug,release}/
//! hecks-build`), fragile the moment that layout changes for any reason
//! unrelated to this crate's own logic. Walking up from the current
//! directory looking for `hecks.gemspec` (a file that names the repo
//! root unambiguously and never moves) is the same technique `bundle
//! exec`/`rspec`/`cargo` themselves already rely on for "find my project
//! root from wherever the user happens to be standing" — robust to being
//! invoked from the repo root or from any subdirectory beneath it.
