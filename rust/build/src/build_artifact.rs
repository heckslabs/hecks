//! **The new part** — actually invoking `cargo build` for the domain's own
//! compiled artifact, native at minimum and optionally WASM. This is
//! what makes the whole pipeline end-to-end: `.bluebook` source in, a
//! compiled binary out, one command, zero Ruby anywhere in the chain —
//! `rust/project_rust_pipeline.rb` (the Ruby orchestrator this crate
//! replaces) stops one step short of this, at "generated Rust source
//! ready for `cargo build`", because its caller (`bin/project_rust`) is
//! itself a Ruby process and this repo's own separate `bin/project_wasm`
//! already does the WASM half by shelling out to `bin/project_rust`
//! first — so neither Ruby script actually needed to also invoke `cargo`
//! from inside itself for the same reason this crate does: for them,
//! Ruby is already running; for this crate, `cargo build` closing the
//! loop in-process is the entire point.
