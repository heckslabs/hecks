# ADR 0029 step 7 — the highest-effort remaining case: an era minted
# with a `compute` rule, the one migration kind with NO in-process Ruby
# reference implementation at all (`Ports::Persistence::Lineage#
# translate`'s own header: "compute is deliberately not applied here...
# this transform neither imitates nor checks it"). Its only
# verification anywhere in this project is the human-approved sample
# the real audit records — mint refuses outright without a matching,
# unstale approval (`lineage_manager/minter.rb`'s own gate). This
# script is the first thing in the whole codebase that drives that gate
# for real from outside `bin/translation_audit` itself.
#
# BECAUSE there is no in-process reference transform for `compute`, this
# fixture's own "ground truth" is necessarily narrower than mint_and_
# seed_lineage.rb's: it can only be Postgres's own compiled SQL
# (`head_compiler.rb`'s `compile_compute`), read directly — proving
# "Rust's read agrees with what Postgres's compiled SQL actually
# produced," not "Rust agrees with an independent Ruby computation."
# That is the honest, narrower claim ADR 0029 itself names for this
# exact case, not a weakening introduced here.
#
# `score`/`doubled` are each wrapped in their own single-member value
# object, not bare scalars — this language refuses a scalar attribute
# directly on an aggregate outright ("attributes must use value-object
# types", meta_validator/judge.rb's own comment on that refusal), found
# live writing this fixture's first draft. `compile_compute`'s own SQL
# (head_compiler.rb) only ever extracts a FLAT `->>'` key, so the
# compute's `sql:` expression re-parses the extracted VO's own JSON
# text and rebuilds a proper `{"value": ...}` object as its result,
# rather than the compute rule needing any dotted-path support the
# generator doesn't have.
