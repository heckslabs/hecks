# ADR-0030-in-progress step 8 — the differential proof `mint_harness`
# (rust/host/src/bin/mint_harness.rs) exists for: THE SAME declared
# edge, minted INDEPENDENTLY by Ruby's own `LineageManager.check!`/
# `mint!` and by Rust's own boot-gate mint path (`mint_harness`, not a
# synthetic shortcut — the real `decide_boot_action` -> hold_first/
# audit_before_mint/mint_era sequence `bootstrap`'s own boot gate
# runs), must produce byte-identical `_head` views.
#
# Every EARLIER example in spec/rust_host_lineage_conformance_spec.rb
# (ADR 0029) proves Rust READS/WRITES an era RUBY minted correctly —
# structurally weaker than this: it never proves Rust's OWN mint (the
# DDL, the compiled matview, the translated data) agrees with Ruby's
# independently-produced one. This is the first fixture in this
# codebase where BOTH sides of the diff are a REAL mint, in two
# different languages, against two separate scratch databases.
#
# Each side writes through its OWN real generic write path — Ruby's
# `PostgresEra#save`, Rust's `lineage_harness`'s own `write` op (already
# separately proven correct by this spec file's OWN second example) —
# not a raw byte-identical INSERT, so this proves the FULL stack agrees
# (mint AND write), the actual end-to-end claim ADR-0030-in-progress
# makes, not a narrower "the DDL text matches" one.
#
# `ir.json` for each shape comes from `Hecks::Projector::Exporter.
# call`/`.translations` DIRECTLY — the SAME calls `bin/project_rust`
# itself makes to build the real `ir.json` sidecar every deployed
# domain ships — not a hand-approximated JSON shape this fixture
# invented for itself.
