// A direct port of `Adapters::Lambda::Client` (lib/hecks/adapters/
// driven/lambda/client.rb) — read that file's own header first; this is
// the same thin, single-purpose wrapper (one Lambda invoke, one JSON
// round trip, the same "hecks-<domain>" function-name convention)
// for the one call site orchestrate.rs's own header names: a policy whose
// `across:` target domain isn't the one this process's own compiled
// `.wasm` module holds. That module runs inside wasmtime's sandbox
// (rust/host/Cargo.toml's own header, main.rs's own header) — no network,
// structurally — so it can only match a cross-domain policy and hand back
// a `PendingCrossDomainReaction` (kernel::cli's "cross_domain_reactions"
// JSON output); this module is what actually delivers it, from the one
// layer in this whole project with real AWS SDK access.
//
// Function name is computed from a declared string, not a path/basename —
// unlike `Adapters::Lambda::Client`'s own constructor, which resolves its
// own domain name from `ENV["DOMAIN_NAME"] || File.basename(registry.
// root)` specifically because `root` is always `/var/task` inside a
// deployed Lambda (that class's own comment: "a real, live
// AccessDeniedException on 'hecks-task' caught this"). This module
// has no equivalent guess to make: a cross-domain policy's target domain
// is baked into the generated `CrossDomainPolicyRule` table at codegen
// time, straight from its own `across "X"` declaration
// (rust/project/reactions.rb's `emit_cross_domain_policy_table`) — never
// derived from a path or working directory, so the whole bug class Ruby's
// comment documents structurally cannot recur here.
//
// **The trait boundary** — `LambdaInvoker` — exists for exactly the reason
// `Adapters::Lambda::Client` itself is already a thin wrapper around one
// `Aws::Lambda::Client#invoke` call: everything this module can actually
// prove without live AWS infrastructure (the function name computed
// correctly, the payload shaped correctly, a domain-level refusal
// recognized correctly and swallowed the same way a same-domain policy
// reaction already is, a hard invoke fault propagated rather than
// swallowed) is provable against any implementer of this trait — this
// file's own `tests` module exercises exactly that, against a
// hand-written mock, with no real `aws_sdk_lambda::Client` or AWS
// credentials involved at all. `AwsLambdaInvoker`, below, is the one
// piece of this file that cannot be exercised here: it is real AWS SDK
// glue, structurally unverifiable without a second real domain's Lambda
// actually deployed and invocable. Its own doc comment says so plainly.
