// **The rehydrate-and-replay journal** — flat and deliberately non-era-
// aware, domain-agnostic: one table for the whole domain's command
// history, not one per aggregate. This journal alone has no era/lineage
// concept (by design, not by gap — see the generic lineage read/write
// functions further down this file for the part of this crate that
// does), and rust/host has no type information about aggregates/
// commands (that knowledge lives only inside the compiled `.wasm`
// module, which this crate treats as opaque) — so filtering "which
// prior commands matter for this one" isn't something rust/host can
// safely do on its own. Replaying the full log on every invocation is
// the simplest correct answer for a company-internal tool with modest
// total event volume; see docs/implemented/decisions/0018-rehydrate-replay-lambda-
// host.md for the full tradeoff.
//
// Determinism is what makes this safe to persist selectively: every
// prior journal row was, by construction, a command that succeeded the
// first time it was dispatched — replaying the exact same steps against
// the exact same (empty-start) kernel must produce the exact same
// result again. So the only step in a full replay that can legitimately
// end up in `refusals` is the newest one, appended last. That's the
// entire correctness argument `append_if_accepted` below leans on.
