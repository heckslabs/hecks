# Entity

<!-- generated:begin id=page -->
Words available inside `entity do ... end`.

*The tables on this page are generated from the language's own
aggregate-local syntax tables (`lib/hecks/language/**/*.bluebook`)
by `bin/reference` — do not edit inside the markers. The prose
between them is hand-written and survives regeneration.*

Seven of these nine run against `examples/banking`'s `LedgerEntry` — the
movements inside an `Account`, which have their own identity, their own
state machine and their own commands, but no life apart from the account
holding them. `reference_to` and nested `entity` appear on no entity
anywhere in the real corpus, so both get a small chapter of their own
further down.

## description

<!-- generated:begin word=description -->
`description description` — fills `description`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | description |
<!-- generated:end -->

A free-text label for the entity — no rules attached, read by nothing but a human. Same word, same shape, as an aggregate's own `description`.

Carried on the IR, not on any record — nothing at runtime reads it:

```ruby
ledger_entry = runtime.registry.bluebook("Banking").aggregate("Account").entities.first
ledger_entry.description  # => "One movement across the account, in the order it was posted."
```

## identified_by

<!-- generated:begin word=identified_by -->
`identified_by identified_by, type, as: do ... end` / `identified_by identified_by, type, as:` — opens a `ValueObject` body, fills `identified_by`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | false | identified_by |
| positional 1 | constant | false | type |
| `as:` | symbol | false | name |
<!-- generated:end -->

Names the field that tells one element of the list apart from another — unique within the parent, not globally, since a `FoyerTicketNumber` only has to be unambiguous inside its own counter. See entities.md for how this identity is carried alongside the parent's own when a command or query reaches through the aggregate.

`LedgerEntry` is `identified_by :sequence` (with `attribute :sequence,
LedgerSequence` declared alongside it), and the sequence only has to
be unique inside its own account — every account starts counting at
one:

```ruby
account.ledger.map { |entry| entry[:sequence][:value] }  # => [1, 2]
```

Which is why reaching one takes BOTH identities: the parent's, then the
entity's own.

## given

<!-- generated:begin word=given -->
`given description, declared_by: do ... end` — fills `preconditions`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | description |
| `declared_by:` | text | false | declared_by |
<!-- generated:end -->

The SAME word an aggregate declares (see aggregate.md's own "given"),
one level down: a precondition shared across this entity's OWN
commands, declared once — block required — and referenced back by
name, with no block of its own, from any command that needs it. The
resolved canonical predicate lands on the referencing command's own
`givens` either way, so a command's own rule enforcement is identical
whichever construct declared the wording.

`LedgerEntry` declares three — `"entry is posted"`, `"customer is
active"`, and `"account is open"` — and both `Amend` and `Reverse` read
them all back rather than retyping the `parent.`-qualified predicates
(`bin/codemod_hoist_local_givens` hoisted the third, "entry is
posted", from the two commands' own identical local declarations —
the exact same duplication this entity's other two preconditions were
hand-hoisted for, round 4's own motivating case):

```ruby
ledger_entry = runtime.registry.bluebook("Banking").aggregate("Account")
                       .entities.find { |e| e.hecks_name == "LedgerEntry" }
ledger_entry.preconditions.map(&:description)  # => ["entry is posted", "customer is active", "account is open"]
ledger_entry.commands.find { |c| c.hecks_name == "Amend" }.givens.map(&:description)  # => ["customer is active", "account is open", "entry is posted", "an amendment leaves a non-negative amount"]
```

Same canonical text either way — a referencing command's own `given`
carries the entity's declared predicate, not a copy:

```ruby
ledger_entry.commands.find { |c| c.hecks_name == "Reverse" }.givens.map(&:canonical)  # => ["parent.customer_status == \"active\"", "parent.status == \"open\"", "state == \"posted\""]
```

`given` also SHARES CHAPTER-WIDE, ACROSS AGGREGATES — a bare
`given(description)`, written directly inside a DIFFERENT aggregate's
own entity, resolves against whichever piece anywhere in the same
chapter already declared that description, the identical move
`aggregate.md`'s own "given" makes one level up
(`docs/implemented/resolution-rules/chapter-entity-given.md`).
`SafeDepositBox::Visit` names `Account::LedgerEntry`'s own "customer is
active" back rather than retyping `parent.customer_status == "active"`
a second time — a genuinely different aggregate, the identical
canonical, since both pieces' own owning aggregate carries the
identical-named projected field (`projects :customer_status`):

```ruby
visit = runtime.registry.bluebook("Banking").aggregate("SafeDepositBox")
               .entities.find { |e| e.hecks_name == "Visit" }
visit.preconditions.map { |g| [g.description, g.canonical] }  # => [["customer is active", "parent.customer_status == \"active\""], ["box is rented", "parent.status == \"rented\""]]
```

`declared_by:` disambiguates the same way it does one level up — only
needed once the same description means a genuinely different predicate
somewhere else in the chapter's own pieces; omitted here because
`Account::LedgerEntry` is currently the only piece in this chapter
declaring "customer is active" with a block.

## invariant

<!-- generated:begin word=invariant -->
`invariant description do ... end` — fills `invariants`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | description |
<!-- generated:end -->

The SAME word an aggregate declares (see aggregate.md's own
"invariant") and a value object declares (value_object.md's own),
checked one level further down than either: not once against the
aggregate's own flat state, and not once per VALUE OBJECT instance,
but against EVERY INSTANCE of this piece the aggregate holds — a
`list_of` field's every element, checked the same two points
(after every mutation, before save) the aggregate's own invariants
already run at (`Admissibility#enforce_invariants`'s own recursive
walk). No reference-by-name form, unlike `given` — no known corpus
need yet for one piece's own invariant to be shared with a sibling
piece; `given`'s own cross-entity write-through is where that
capability would extend from if the need shows up.

`Visit` declares one — `"a written note is not blank"` — checked
against every visit `SafeDepositBox` holds, not just the one a
command just touched:

```ruby
visit = runtime.registry.bluebook("Banking").aggregate("SafeDepositBox")
               .entities.find { |e| e.hecks_name == "Visit" }
visit.invariants.map(&:description)  # => ["a written note is not blank"]
```

Something a VALUE OBJECT invariant on `VisitNote` itself could not
express: `note` is OPTIONAL, so a VO invariant on it never even runs
when a visit carries none — correct for absence, but blind to
"present, and empty." Only the OWNING piece, reading its own optional
field, can tell those two apart:

```ruby
visit.invariants.first.canonical  # => "!note || !note.text.to_s.empty?"
```

## command

<!-- generated:begin word=command -->
`command name, from: do ... end` — opens a `Command` body

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | name |
| `from:` | literal | false | from |
<!-- generated:end -->

Same vocabulary as a command on an aggregate — see command.md — but this one never gets a door of its own: nothing installs a module for an entity, so it's reached only as `Aggregate.Entity.Command`, never independently. It also never declares `reference_to`; the parent qualifier in the dotted call already supplies both identities.

`Reverse` is `LedgerEntry`'s, not `Account`'s — addressed through the
account that holds it, and naming which entry by its own sequence:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.LedgerEntry.Reverse", number: { value: "en-a1" },
                 sequence: { value: 2 }, narrative: { text: "posted in error" })
Banking::Account.find("en-a1").ledger[1][:state]  # => "reversed"
```

The other entry is untouched — a command on one element is not a command
on the list:

```ruby
Banking::Account.find("en-a1").ledger[0][:state]  # => "posted"
```

### Reading through `parent`

Not a grammar word — `parent` is a plain Ruby method
(`Runtime::EntityInterpreter#parent`), reachable only INSIDE a `given`/
`ensures` expression written on an entity's own command. An entity has
no life apart from the aggregate holding it, so its own rules
routinely need to ask about THAT record, one level up — `LedgerEntry`'s
own `Amend`/`Reverse` both check the owning `Account`'s customer and
the account's own lifecycle state before touching one entry:

```ruby
reverse = runtime.registry.bluebook("Banking").aggregate("Account")
                  .entities.find { |e| e.hecks_name == "LedgerEntry" }
                  .commands.find { |c| c.hecks_name == "Reverse" }
reverse.givens.map(&:canonical)  # => ["parent.customer_status == \"active\"", "parent.status == \"open\"", "state == \"posted\""]
```

Enforced, not decorative — a fresh account whose customer is
suspended refuses an entry-level command through exactly this
reading, before `state == "posted"` (the entry's OWN field, no
`parent.` needed) is ever reached:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", with: { reference: { value: "pa-1" },
                                                       name: { given: "Parent", family: "Reader" }, email: { address: "pa@example.com" } })
account = Banking::Account.open!(customer: "pa-1", number: { value: "pa-a1" },
                                kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 50_000 })
account.credit!(amount: { cents: 1_000 }, narrative: { text: "opening deposit" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Suspend", reference: "pa-1", standing: { value: "under review" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.LedgerEntry.Reverse", number: { value: "pa-a1" }, sequence: { value: 1 }, narrative: { text: "reversing" })  # ~> GivenNotMet: customer is active
```

## query

<!-- generated:begin word=query -->
`query name do ... end` — opens a `Query` body

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | name |
<!-- generated:end -->

Reached the same dotted way a command is — `Aggregate.Entity.Query` — and answers across every parent that has a matching element, each row stamped with which parent it came from.

`Reversed` reads entries, not accounts — and each row says which account
it came from, under that parent's own reference key:

```ruby
rows = runtime.query("Banking::Account.LedgerEntry.Reversed")
rows.size  # => 1
rows.first[:account]  # => "en-a1"
```

## lifecycle

<!-- generated:begin word=lifecycle -->
`lifecycle state_field, default: do ... end` — fills `state_field`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | true | state_field |
| `default:` | literal | true | state_start |
<!-- generated:end -->

Opens the same `transition` vocabulary an aggregate's `lifecycle` does, checked against this entity's own state field — a `LifecycleRefused` here names the entity, never the parent. See the Lifecycle context page.

`LedgerEntry` declares `lifecycle :state, default: "posted"`, and the
entry above has already moved. Reversing it twice is refused against the
ENTRY's state — the account is still perfectly open:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.LedgerEntry.Reverse", number: { value: "en-a1" }, sequence: { value: 2 }, narrative: { text: "again" })  # ~> GivenNotMet: entry is posted
```

```ruby
Banking::Account.find("en-a1").status  # => "open"
```

## attribute

<!-- generated:begin word=attribute -->
`attribute name, type, default:, optional:, pattern:, admits:, one_of:` — fills `attributes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | true | name |
| positional 2 | constant | true | type |
| `default:` | literal | false | default |
| `optional:` | flag | false | optional |
| `pattern:` | text | false | pattern |
| `admits:` | text | false | admits |
| `one_of:` | list | false | one_of |
<!-- generated:end -->

Declares a field on the entity, scalar or value object — same word, same modifiers, as an aggregate's own `attribute`. See the Type and ValueObject context pages for what each type position and modifier does.

An entity's fields are its own, and they are read off the element rather
than off the parent:

```ruby
Banking::Account.find("en-a1").ledger[0][:amount][:cents]  # => 10000
Banking::Account.find("en-a1").ledger[0][:direction][:value]  # => "credit"
```

## reference_to

<!-- generated:begin word=reference_to -->
`reference_to type, as:, optional:` — fills `attributes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | constant | true | type |
| `as:` | symbol | false | name |
| `optional:` | flag | false | optional |
<!-- generated:end -->

Points an entity at a real ROOT, the same way an aggregate's own `reference_to` does — a `Card` entity's own `assignee_id`, pointing at a `Team`. Never at another entity: there's no cross-piece addressing anywhere in this language to resolve one against, so this only ever reaches a head.

`EntityReference`'s `Crate` is an entity inside `Manifest`, pointing at a
`Depot` — a real root of its own, not another piece:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Depot.OpenDepot", with: { code: { value: "dp-1" } })
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Depot.OpenDepot", with: { code: { value: "dp-2" } })
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Manifest.OpenManifest", with: { docket: { value: "mf-1" } })
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Manifest.AddCrate", manifest: "mf-1", slot: { value: 1 },
                 handler: { value: "Ada" }, depot: "dp-1", origin: "dp-1")
```

The reference is stored on the crate itself, one field among its own:

```ruby
EntityReference::Manifest.find("mf-1").crates.first[:depot]  # => "dp-1"
```

## has_many

<!-- generated:begin word=has_many -->
`has_many type, as:` — fills `attributes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | constant | true | type |
| `as:` | symbol | false | name |
<!-- generated:end -->

The one shape `reference_to`/`has_one`/`belongs_to` cannot express at all — a LIST of targets, admitting zero, never refused for being empty the way a required singular relationship is (`validate_relationship_cardinality`'s own early return on `attribute.list?`). `waypoints` is every depot this crate has passed through in transit, set here without ever touching `destination` (`has_one`'s own section, next) — a required list needs no partner value the way a required singular field would:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Manifest.Crate.Route", docket: { value: "mf-1" }, slot: { value: 1 },
                 waypoints: ["dp-1", "dp-2"])
EntityReference::Manifest.find("mf-1").crates.first[:waypoints]  # => ["dp-1", "dp-2"]
```

## has_one

<!-- generated:begin word=has_one -->
`has_one type, as:, optional:` — fills `attributes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | constant | true | type |
| `as:` | symbol | false | name |
| `optional:` | flag | false | optional |
<!-- generated:end -->

`belongs_to` with `optional: true` and a name read from the OTHER direction — one target, but not every crate has been assigned one yet. `Route` (above) left `destination` unset on purpose, to show the difference `validate_relationship_cardinality` (`command_rules/references.rb`) actually enforces: `belongs_to`'s own `origin` below would refuse a nil the same way a bare `reference_to` does; `has_one`'s `optional: true` is what a required relationship's own refusal reads as when it is turned off:

```ruby
EntityReference::Manifest.find("mf-1").crates.first[:destination]  # => nil
```

## belongs_to

<!-- generated:begin word=belongs_to -->
`belongs_to type, as:, optional:` — fills `attributes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | constant | true | type |
| `as:` | symbol | false | name |
| `optional:` | flag | false | optional |
<!-- generated:end -->

The same word an aggregate's own `belongs_to` is (`aggregate.md`'s own section — `SafeDepositBox`'s real `belongs_to Customer`), one level in: mints the identical `reference_to`-shaped attribute, required by default, named for which side of the relationship a piece is on rather than for its mechanism. `Crate`'s own `origin` is the depot it started from — every crate has one from the moment `AddCrate` creates it, the same "required" rule `reference_to`'s own `depot` above is under:

```ruby
EntityReference::Manifest.find("mf-1").crates.first[:origin]  # => "dp-1"
```

## entity

<!-- generated:begin word=entity -->
`entity name do ... end` — opens a `Entity` body

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | name |
<!-- generated:end -->

A piece nested inside a piece — the same word, opening the same body, one level further in than `Manifest`'s own `entity "Crate"` above. `EntityReference`'s `Crate` nests `Seal`: one inspection stamp, inside one crate, inside one manifest — "no life outside its Crate," the same way `Crate` itself has no life outside `Manifest`.

A nested entity is created the same way any entity is: by its OWNER's own append command, never by a creating verb of its own. `Crate.Seal` is Crate's own command, and reaching it takes both outer identities — Manifest's own `docket`, then Crate's own `slot` — the same two-part reach `command.md`'s own reading through `parent` already uses one level down:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Manifest.Crate.Seal", docket: { value: "mf-1" }, slot: { value: 1 }, stamp: { value: "inspected-1" })
EntityReference::Manifest.find("mf-1").crates.first[:seals].map { |seal| seal[:stamp][:value] }  # => ["inspected-1"]
```

A second seal appends beside the first — nested data, ordinary list semantics:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("EntityReference::Manifest.Crate.Seal", docket: { value: "mf-1" }, slot: { value: 1 }, stamp: { value: "inspected-2" })
EntityReference::Manifest.find("mf-1").crates.first[:seals].size  # => 2
```
