# TranslationAggregate

<!-- generated:begin id=page -->
Words available inside `aggregate do ... end`.

*The tables on this page are generated from the language's own
aggregate-local syntax tables (`lib/hecks/language/**/*.bluebook`)
by `hecks language_run.project_reference` — do not edit inside the markers. The prose
between them is hand-written and survives regeneration.*
<!-- generated:end -->

One aggregate's own table of rules, exercised together — every rule
but `unresolved` (which only ever refuses; see its own section below):

```ruby boot
Hecks.data_translation("ReferenceDomain2", from: "1", to: "2") do
  aggregate "Account" do
    rename  :old_field, to: :new_field
    move    "old.path",  to: "new.path"
    convert "status",    to: "state", values: { "open" => "active" }
    drop    :legacy_field
    retype  "OldType",   to: "NewType"
    compute "amount",    to: "cents", sql: "amount * 100"
    rekey sql: "new_id_expr"
    backfill :standing, default: "good"
  end
end
```

## rename

<!-- generated:begin word=rename -->
`rename old_name, to:` — fills `renames`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | true | old_name |
| `to:` | symbol | true | to |
<!-- generated:end -->

A field kept its structure and only its name changed — the smallest rule, and the one every migration reaches for first. Accumulates into a plain old-name-to-new-name table.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.renames  # => {old_field: :new_field}
```

## move

<!-- generated:begin word=move -->
`move old_path, to:` — fills `moves`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | old_path |
| `to:` | text | true | to |
<!-- generated:end -->

One field crossing a value-object boundary — a scalar becoming a VO member, a VO member becoming a scalar, or a rename across the move. Paths are dotted (`"price.cents"`) to reach a VO member, bare otherwise — text rather than `rename`'s bare symbol, since a path can be more than one name.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.moves.first.to_h  # => {from: "old.path", to: "new.path"}
```

## convert

<!-- generated:begin word=convert -->
`convert old_path, to:, values:` — fills `converts`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | old_path |
| `to:` | text | true | to |
| `values:` | literal | true | values |
<!-- generated:end -->

A value with nothing structural in common with its replacement — declared as an exhaustive table, not computed, so every value that can appear in old data has a named destination. `values:` is captured as arbitrary, unvalidated data (the same `LiteralText` shape `provenance` already uses), since what a real migration's own lookup table holds is open-ended.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.converts.first.to_h  # => {from: "status", to: "state", values: {"open" => "active"}}
```

## drop

<!-- generated:begin word=drop -->
`drop name` — fills `drops`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | true | name |
<!-- generated:end -->

A declared, deliberate acknowledgment that an attribute's data does not survive the move — the honest alternative to letting it silently vanish because nothing named it.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.drops  # => [:legacy_field]
```

## retype

<!-- generated:begin word=retype -->
`retype old_type, to:` — fills `retypes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | old_type |
| `to:` | text | true | to |
<!-- generated:end -->

A value object's or entity's own TYPE NAME changed, its member structure unchanged. Stored data never carries the type name, so nothing moves — this declares that the pair of names means the same shape, which is what lets the era diff accept it.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.retypes.first.to_h  # => {from: "OldType", to: "NewType"}
```

## compute

<!-- generated:begin word=compute -->
`compute old_path, to:, sql:` — fills `computes`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | text | true | old_path |
| `to:` | text | true | to |
| `sql:` | text | true | sql |
<!-- generated:end -->

A computed transform whose only implementation is the SQL expression itself — Postgres-only by construction. The scaffold never proposes one; a human writes it, and the audit's human-sampled review is its only verification.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.computes.first.to_h  # => {from: "amount", to: "cents", sql: "amount * 100"}
```

## rekey

<!-- generated:begin word=rekey -->
`rekey sql:` — fills `rekeys`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sql:` | text | true | sql |
<!-- generated:end -->

THE AGGREGATE'S OWN IDENTITY, recomputed — not a field crossing a boundary (`move`), not a value's own transform (`compute`): the record's key. No path arguments, unlike every other rule here, because nothing is consumed from or moved into `state`, only what identifies the record. Same SQL-only, human-reviewed-sample-is-the-only-verification shape `compute` already has.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.rekeys.first.to_h  # => {sql: "new_id_expr"}
```

## backfill

<!-- generated:begin word=backfill -->
`backfill name, default:` — fills `backfills`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | true | name |
| `default:` | literal | true | default |
<!-- generated:end -->

A newly added, required attribute — the addition-side sibling of `drop`. Nothing to rename, move, or convert FROM, since old data never held this field at all; `default:` (captured the same open-ended way `convert`'s `values:` is) is what an existing record reads until the next command against it writes a real value.

```ruby
runtime.registry.translations.last.aggregates.first.backfills.first.to_h  # => {name: :standing, default: "good"}
```

## unresolved

<!-- generated:begin word=unresolved -->
`unresolved name, candidates:`

| argument | kind | required | fills |
|---|---|---|---|
| positional 1 | symbol | true | name |
| `candidates:` | list | false | candidates |
<!-- generated:end -->

The scaffold writes this where it cannot decide on its own — a file carrying one can only boot into this refusal, never a guess. `candidates:` names what the scaffold considered and rejected, folded into the refusal message; omitted, the message says no candidate matched at all.

```ruby
Hecks.data_translation("ReferenceDomainBad", from: "1", to: "2") { aggregate("Account") { unresolved :some_field } }  # ~> Malformed: leaves :some_field unresolved
```
