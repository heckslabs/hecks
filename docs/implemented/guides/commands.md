# Commands

You are about to ship a feature, and the feature is a command: some
actor does something to your domain, and the domain either does it or
says why not. Before you write one, you need three things — the full
inventory of what a command can declare (there is nothing else), the
exceptions your caller has to be ready to catch, and the difference
between a rule you enforce going in and a guarantee you check coming
out. All three are provable in one sitting, against a real domain.

The examples below use `examples/banking/bluebook/` —
customers hold accounts, accounts move money, cards get disputed,
scheduled payments retry themselves against a limit, and a compliance
officer freezes what needs investigating. It is a real, running
domain, not a rehearsal: every dispatch below is a real command
declared in that file, executed against a real boot of it.

## The declaration

A command is `role`, `goal`, an optional `from:` lifecycle guard, one
or more `attribute`s, an optional `reference_to`, zero or more
`given`s, zero or more `ensures`, zero or more `sets`s, and one or more
`emits` — nothing else, no handler body to smuggle a side effect into.
`Account`'s own commands carry every piece of that inventory at least
once, quoted here directly from the bluebook (never run as shown — the
boot below loads the real file instead of retyping it), alongside the
two named preconditions the aggregate itself declares once and its
commands reference back rather than re-typing:

```ruby skip
# Declared once, directly on Account, above its lifecycle and its commands:
given("customer is active")     { customer.status == "active" }
given("customer is not closed") { customer.status != "closed" }

command "Open" do
  role "Branch clerk"
  goal "Give a customer somewhere to keep money"

  reference_to Customer
  attribute :number,      AccountNumber
  attribute :kind,        AccountKind
  attribute :daily_limit, DailyLimit
  given("customer is active")

  sets :number
  sets :kind
  sets :daily_limit

  emits "AccountOpened"
end

command "Credit", from: "open" do
  role "Teller"
  goal "Put money in"

  reference_to Account
  attribute :amount,    PositiveMoney
  attribute :narrative, Narrative

  given("customer is active")
  sets :balance, increment: :amount
  sets :ledger,  append: { amount: :amount, narrative: :narrative, direction: { value: "credit" } }

  emits "AccountCredited"
end

command "Debit", from: "open" do
  role "Teller"
  goal "Take money out, if it is there to take"

  reference_to Account
  attribute :amount,    PositiveMoney
  attribute :narrative, Narrative

  given("customer is active")
  given("the balance covers it")     { balance.cents >= amount.cents }
  given("the daily limit allows it") { daily_limit.cents >= amount.cents }

  sets :balance, decrement: :amount
  sets :ledger,  append: { amount: :amount, narrative: :narrative, direction: { value: "debit" } }

  ensures("the balance fell by exactly the amount") { old.balance.cents == balance.cents + amount.cents }
  ensures("a ledger entry was posted")               { ledger.size == old.ledger.size + 1 }

  emits "AccountDebited"
end

command "FreezeAccount", from: "open" do
  role "Compliance officer"
  goal "Stop an account moving while something is investigated"

  reference_to Account
  given("customer is not closed")
  emits "AccountFrozen"
end
```

`Open` takes in a customer and gives back a fresh account: a creating
command, one referenced `given`, three bare `sets` (each one's `to:`
would only repeat the target, so it's omitted). `Credit` and `Debit`
are where the rest of the inventory earns its place — `from:` guarding
entry by lifecycle state, a `given` guarding mutation by a fact the
lifecycle knows nothing about, `sets increment:`/`decrement:` doing
arithmetic, `sets append:` growing the ledger, and, on `Debit` alone,
two real `ensures`. `FreezeAccount` is the floor of the inventory once
`from:` is counted alongside `given`: `role`, `goal`, `from:`,
`reference_to`, one referenced `given`, `emits` — a command needs no
free-text rule of its own, no `attribute`, no `sets`, to be a complete
one, as long as the aggregate's own lifecycle and its own named
preconditions already say what needs saying. Notice what is GONE from
both `Credit` and `Debit`: no `given("the account is open") { status
== "open" }` — that fact is now `from: "open"`, checked against the
real state machine instead of a free-text copy of it (see `from:`,
below).

## Wiring

```ruby boot
Hecks::Adapters::Folder.new.load_bluebooks(File.join(InMemoryDomain::ROOT, "examples/banking/bluebook"))

Hecks.hecksagon("Banking") do
  uses_framework "Governance"
  Banking::Customer.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::Account.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::CardPayment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::ScheduledPayment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::SafeDepositBox.persisted_by("Memory")
end
Hecks.hecksagon("Governance") do
  Governance::RoleAssignment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Governance::RoleTransition.persisted_by("Memory")
end
```

## What you must handle

Every command you write can fail in a fixed set of ways, and your
caller — a controller action, a saga step, a test — has to be ready for
whichever ones apply to it. This is the complete roster for a command
dispatch; the rest of this page proves each row once, live, against
`Banking`:

| raises | when | shown |
|---|---|---|
| `GivenNotMet` | a declared `given` reads false | debiting more than the balance covers |
| `EnsuresNotMet` | a declared `ensures` reads false, AFTER the mutation ran | `Debit`'s own two postconditions — discussed below |
| `InvariantViolation` | a value object's own rule rejects the fields it was built from | an account opened with no number |
| `LifecycleRefused` | a command's own `from:` names a state the record isn't in, or a `transition` target the lifecycle can't reach from here | discussed below, and in `lifecycles.md` — freezing an already-frozen account |
| `AlreadyExists` | a creating command's identity already names a record | opening the same account number twice |
| `NotFound` | an acting command's identity names no record | freezing an account that was never opened |
| `AbsentArgument` | a required attribute never arrived | opening an account with no `kind` |
| `UnknownArgument` | an argument arrived that the command never declared | crediting with a stray `memo:` |
| `TypeMismatch` | an argument arrived in the wrong shape — a reference handed as an object is the case that costs the most in practice | a customer passed as an object instead of an id |

Every one of these is a `StandardError` subclass under
`Hecks::Runtime`, and every one is the domain answering, not the
runtime breaking. A refusal is a response, not a malfunction.

## Creating vs. acting

A command either creates a new record or acts on one that already
exists, and the DSL reads this off one fact: does the command
`reference_to` its own aggregate. `Open` doesn't — it references
`Customer`, a different aggregate, to say whose account this is — so
`Open` creates, and the facade installs it as a method on the
aggregate module itself. `Credit`, `Debit`, and `FreezeAccount` all
`reference_to Account`, their own aggregate, so each is a method on
the record in hand. Get this backwards in your own bluebook — add a
stray `reference_to Self` to what should be a creating command — and
it silently stops being callable the way a controller expects.

```ruby
Banking::Account.respond_to?(:open!)    # => true
Banking::Account.respond_to?(:credit!)  # => false
```

```ruby
customer = Banking::Customer.register!(reference: { value: "C-1" },
                                       name: { given: "Ada", family: "Lovelace" },
                                       email: { address: "ada@example.com" })
account  = Banking::Account.open!(customer: customer.id, number: { value: "AC-1" },
                                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 100_000 })
account.number.to_h  # => { value: "AC-1" }
```

A creating command's identity still has to be FRESH — dispatch `Open`
again with a number you already used and there is no second account,
only a collision with the one you have:

```ruby
Banking::Account.open!(customer: customer.id, number: { value: "AC-1" }, kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 100_000 })  # ~> AlreadyExists: Open creates a Account that already exists
```

## `given` — the rule you enforce going in

A `given` reads the record as it stands BEFORE any mutation and refuses
if it doesn't like what it sees. The refusal is `GivenNotMet`, and the
message is exactly the description you wrote — nothing templated, no
translation between what you declared and what the caller reads.

A `given` can be declared two ways. INLINE, with a block, right where a
command needs it — `Debit`'s own `given("the balance covers it") {
balance.cents >= amount.cents }`. Or NAMED: declared once, directly on
the aggregate (`given("customer is active") { customer.status ==
"active" }`, above `Account`'s own commands), and referenced back by
any command with no block of its own. `Open`, `Credit`, `Debit`, and
`Unfreeze` all read the aggregate's `given("customer is active")` this
way; `FreezeAccount` and `CloseAccount` read its other one,
`given("customer is not closed")`. One description and one predicate,
declared once, is one refusal message no matter which command a caller
hits — the alternative, typed out fresh on every command, is how the
same rule ends up worded three different ways across a corpus without
anyone deciding that on purpose.

`FreezeAccount` carries exactly one `given` — the referenced
`"customer is not closed"`. What used to also live here as a SECOND
`given`, `given("account is open") { status == "open" }`, duplicating a
fact its own `transition "FreezeAccount" => "frozen", from: "open"`
already enforced structurally, is gone: `from: "open"` says it once
now, checked against the real lifecycle field instead of a free-text
copy of it (see `from:`, below):

```ruby
account.freeze_account!
account.status  # => "frozen"
```

Call it again and the `given` still reads true — the customer is not
closed, whatever the account's own status is — so this time nothing
stops the dispatch until `from: "open"` gets its turn, AFTER every
`given` already has. The refusal is `LifecycleRefused`, and it names
the fact your caller actually needs — the state the record is in, and
every state the command would have accepted:

```ruby
account.freeze_account!  # ~> LifecycleRefused: FreezeAccount refused — status is "frozen", and FreezeAccount moves it only from "open"
```

`Debit` declares three givens — the referenced `"customer is active"`,
then its own `"the balance covers it"` and `"the daily limit allows
it"` — and multiple givens run in the order you wrote them: the FIRST
one that reads false is the one your caller sees, and the others never
run at all. `from: "open"` runs separately, only once every `given`
already has, so an amount this account is nowhere near able to cover
blows both its own remaining rules at once, and only the
first-declared one is what you'll ever see:

```ruby
account.unfreeze!
account.debit!(amount: { cents: 999_999 }, narrative: { text: "too much" })  # ~> GivenNotMet: the balance covers it
```

Write your givens with the cheapest or most-likely-to-fail check first
if you want your callers reading the most useful message; the runtime
will not reorder them for you.

A description tells you WHICH rule refused, not what the record's
fields actually held when it did — the gap between "the rule is right
and my data is wrong" and "the rule is subtly wrong." When a `given` is
a bare comparison (`balance.cents >= amount.cents`, not one side of an
`&&`/`||`, and not `.include?`/a bare boolean read — those have no
single honest left/right to show), the raised `GivenNotMet` carries the
comparison's own resolved operands as `#detail`:

```ruby
begin
  account.debit!(amount: { cents: 999_999 }, narrative: { text: "too much" })
rescue Hecks::Runtime::GivenNotMet => e
  e.message # => "Debit refused — the balance covers it"
  e.detail  # => "left: 0, right: 999999"
end
```

`#detail` never changes `#message` — every corpus spec asserting an
exact refusal string keeps passing unchanged. It rides on Ruby's own
`#detailed_message` (3.2+) instead, so it shows up automatically in an
`irb`/Rails console's own unhandled-exception banner without any code
reading `#detail` on purpose.

## `from:` — lifecycle state as a command guard

`command "Debit", from: "open"` (or, on `CloseAccount`, `from: ["open",
"frozen"]`) is a precondition too, but checked against the owning
aggregate's own lifecycle field rather than a predicate you write —
`Account`'s `lifecycle :status` names `"open"` as the one state
`Debit` may run from, and `from:` reads that same declaration rather
than repeating it as text. It never transitions anything itself: no
target state, no state change, nothing `step_advance_lifecycle` ever
sees — a command can carry `from:` with no `lifecycle` block declaring
a real `transition` for it at all, and often does (`Credit` and `Debit`
both do). What `from: "open"` replaces is exactly the
`given("account is open") { status == "open" }` shape `FreezeAccount`
used to carry above — free text that could say `"open"` correctly the
day it was written and drift out of sync with the lifecycle silently
thereafter. `from:` cannot drift: it names a state the lifecycle
itself has to recognize, checked by `enforce_lifecycle_guard`
immediately after every `given` on the same command has already
passed — see `lifecycles.md` for the full mechanism, and
[the DSL reference](../reference/command.md) for the declaration
itself.

A `given` can also name the record ITSELF as the thing it refuses a
second run of. `ScheduledPayment.Retry` declares `given("a retry is
still allowed") { attempts.value < max_attempts.value }` on a command
that `reference_to ScheduledPayment` — its own aggregate — and whose
own `emits "ScheduledPaymentFailed"` is the SAME event a policy in this
chapter answers by triggering `Retry` again. One failed presentment
already re-enters itself, live, up to its own limit, before your code
ever gets control back:

```ruby
sp = Banking::ScheduledPayment.schedule!(account: account.id, instruction: { value: "I-1" },
                                         amount: { cents: 5000 }, recipient: { value: "Landlord" },
                                         due_on: { value: "2026-09-01" })
sp.fail!
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find(sp.id).attempts.to_h  # => { value: 3 }
```

`max_attempts` defaults to 3, and the reflex ran itself out to exactly
that before this line even returned — a refusal raised INSIDE a
policy's own reaction is caught and recorded there, not thrown back at
whoever dispatched the command that started the chain (see
[Policies and process managers](policies-and-process-managers.md) for
the mechanism). Dispatch `Retry` again yourself, directly, and the same
`given` refuses it the ordinary way:

```ruby
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find(sp.id).retry!  # ~> GivenNotMet: a retry is still allowed
```

`Abandon` declares the mirror image — `given("every retry is
exhausted") { attempts.value >= max_attempts.value }` — which only
reads true now that the reflex above has run its course:

```ruby
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find(sp.id).abandon!
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find(sp.id).status  # => "abandoned"
```

## `ensures` — the guarantee you check coming out

A `given` reads the record before the mutation runs. An `ensures` reads
it AFTER — against the settled state, with `old` naming the record as
it stood before, so you can assert a relationship between the two
rather than just a fact about one. `enforce_ensures` is the step right
after `apply_mutations` in the dispatch pipeline, and it still sits
before `save` — a failed `ensures` never reaches the store.

`Debit` carries two, and a credit followed by a debit proves both
without either one raising:

```ruby
account.credit!(amount: { cents: 500 }, narrative: { text: "paycheck" })
account.debit!(amount: { cents: 200 }, narrative: { text: "rent" })
account.balance.to_h  # => { cents: 300, currency: "USD" }
```

Neither of `Debit`'s `ensures` has ever needed to fire here, and that
is not an oversight — it is what its own two `given`s already bought.
"the balance fell by exactly the amount" is arithmetic `decrement:`
guarantees on its own; "a ledger entry was posted" is what `sets
append:` already does on every successful call. Written down anyway,
neither is a trap waiting to be tripped by THIS domain's own commands
— each is what would catch a later edit that loosens or removes the
rule it is quietly protecting.

What is NOT here anymore is "no debit leaves the balance negative" —
that used to be `Debit`'s own third `ensures`, and it was worded three
different ways across the six commands on `Account` that can move
`:balance` (`Debit` as both a `given` and an `ensures`,
`ApplyFee`/`CorrectInterest` as differently-worded `given`s, and the
commands that only ever increase it saying nothing at all).
It is now `Account`'s own `invariant("the balance never goes
negative")`, checked once, after EVERY command that touches the
aggregate, not re-declared on each one that happens to decrease it — a
value object's own `invariant` moved up one level, to the aggregate
that owns the field. A `given` is a rule you remembered to write going
in; an `ensures` is a guarantee that holds regardless of what a future
you remembers about ONE command; an `invariant`, declared directly
inside `aggregate` rather than `value_object`, is the identical
guarantee moved up a level, so a NEW command on the same aggregate
inherits it for free instead of needing its own copy — see
[the DSL reference](../reference/aggregate.md) for the declaration
itself.

## `sets` — one op per field, and the op is a real decision

Four operations, and which one you reach for is not stylistic — it is
the difference between overwriting a field, growing a list, and doing
arithmetic on one.

**`to:`** replaces the field outright, from an argument or a literal —
and is omittable when it would only repeat the target, which is why
`Open`'s own three (above) never spell it out: `sets :number` alone
already means `to: :number`.

```ruby
account.kind.to_h  # => { name: "current" }
```

A literal target is legal too — `Customer.Reinstate` sets its standing
back with `sets :standing, to: { value: "good" }` rather than reading
it off an argument, because a reinstated customer's standing is always
"good", not whatever the caller happened to pass.

**`append:`** grows a list attribute by one value object, built from
the fields you name. `Credit` and `Debit` both append to `Account`'s
`ledger`, and the credit and debit above already proved it grew:

```ruby
account.ledger.map { |entry| entry[:amount].to_h }      # => [{ cents: 500, currency: "USD" }, { cents: 200, currency: "USD" }]
account.ledger.map { |entry| entry[:direction].to_h }    # => [{ value: "credit" }, { value: "debit" }]
```

`direction:` is not an argument at all in either command — `{ value:
"credit" }` and `{ value: "debit" }` are literals baked into the
`sets` itself, the same way `append:` can take a literal alongside
an argument-sourced field. Hand `append:` a value object with more than
one member for a slot the target entity declares as a bare scalar and
it has no single field to flatten to — that refusal is `TypeMismatch: …
cannot stand in for a scalar`, not shown here because no entity field
in this chapter is declared that way, but worth knowing before you
design one that is.

**`increment:` / `decrement:`** do arithmetic on a numeric field —
either a plain Integer or, as here, the one shared Integer field
between two value objects. `Money#cents` and `PositiveMoney#cents`
share a name and a type, and that shared name is what lets the runtime
know which field to add or subtract — already proven above, alongside
the `ensures` that watches the result. `ScheduledPayment.Retry` does
the same arithmetic on a bare Integer instead of a shared field name:
`sets :attempts, increment: { value: 1 }` moved `attempts` from 0
to 3 across the reflex proven in the `given` section above.

## `emits` — a promise made after the write, not before

Events are announced only once the record has actually been saved:
`save` runs before `emit` in the dispatch order, so a command that gets
all the way to raising `EnsuresNotMet` never announces anything —
there is nothing after a refusal for a caller to react to. Read them
back off the record — every attempt above that refused left no mark;
only the ones that actually ran show up:

```ruby
account.events.map(&:name)  # => ["AccountOpened", "AccountFrozen", "AccountUnfrozen", "AccountCredited", "AccountDebited"]
```

One command can announce more than one fact. `SafeDepositBox.Surrender`
does — the box is given back, and the keys still outstanding against it
are a separate fact worth their own event, not a detail folded into the
first. A composite identity like this one — `branch_code` and
`box_number` together — is addressed by naming both parts directly
rather than through the single-argument facade sugar used above:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::SafeDepositBox.Rent", with: { customer: customer.id,
                                                         branch_code: { value: "DT" }, box_number: { value: 12 }, size: { value: "small" } })
runtime.dispatch_flat("Banking::SafeDepositBox.Surrender", branch_code: { value: "DT" }, box_number: { value: 12 })
Banking::SafeDepositBox.find("DT:12").events.last(2).map(&:name)  # => ["BoxSurrendered", "KeyReturnDue"]
```

## The argument gate

Before any rule runs, before the record is even hydrated, a command's
arguments are checked for shape. Five things to know before you wire a
caller to one of these:

A required attribute that never arrives refuses before anything else
happens — no partial record, no half-run mutation:

```ruby
Banking::Account.open!(customer: customer.id, number: { value: "AC-2" }, daily_limit: { cents: 0 })  # ~> AbsentArgument: Open was not given kind
```

An argument the command never declared at all refuses just as early,
the other half of the same gate — a misspelled or stray field does not
ride along in silence:

```ruby
account.credit!(amount: { cents: 100 }, narrative: { text: "x" }, memo: "nope")  # ~> UnknownArgument: Credit does not declare memo
```

A value object's own rules travel with it into every command that
carries one, checked the moment the argument is coerced — before
`Open`'s given, before its identity is even looked up. A `pattern:` a
value object declares is checked first, ahead of any hand-written
`invariant` on the same field — `AccountNumber` carries both a
`pattern:` (non-whitespace-somewhere) and a presence invariant, so a
blank number is refused as a `TypeMismatch`, not the more specific
`InvariantViolation` its own invariant would otherwise raise:

```ruby
Banking::Account.open!(customer: customer.id, number: { value: "" }, kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 0 })  # ~> TypeMismatch: AccountNumber.value must match [^ \t\n\r], got ""
```

A value object arrives as its fields, plainly — `{ name: "current" }`,
`{ cents: 100 }` — never as a constructed instance. A reference to
another aggregate, by contrast, arrives as a bare id — the string
`customer.id`, not an object describing the customer:

```ruby
Banking::Account.open!(customer: { reference: customer.id }, number: { value: "AC-4" }, kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 0 })  # ~> TypeMismatch: a reference is an id, and customer arrived as an object
```

`CardPayment.Dispute` is the one command in this chapter carrying BOTH
a self reference and a cross-aggregate one at once — `reference_to
CardPayment` makes it act on the payment in hand, and `reference_to
Customer, as: :disputed_by` names who is challenging the charge, since
neither the payment nor its account says which holder of a joint
account raised the dispute. The same rule about a bare id applies to
that second reference exactly as it did to `Open`'s:

```ruby
cp = Banking::CardPayment.authorize!(account: account.id, authorisation: { value: "AUTH-1" },
                                     amount: { cents: 4200 }, merchant: { value: "Cafe" })
cp.capture!
cp.dispute!(disputed_by: { reference: customer.id })  # ~> TypeMismatch: a reference is an id, and disputed_by arrived as an object
cp.dispute!(disputed_by: customer.id)
cp[:disputed_by]  # => "C-1"
```

And a command acting on an identity that names no record refuses with
`NotFound`, not a nil you have to check for yourself:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.FreezeAccount", to: "no-such-account")  # ~> NotFound: no Account with number.value
```

## Refusals leave state untouched

A refusal that happens after mutation but before save — an `ensures`,
mainly — never reaches the store. A `given` that refuses, a
`LifecycleRefused`, a dangling reference, all stop the same dispatch
pipeline the same way: a command either completes and persists, or it
refuses and the record you already had stands exactly as it was. The
account above still holds exactly what its last SUCCESSFUL debit left
it at, not whatever a refused call tried to write:

```ruby
account.debit!(amount: { cents: 999_999 }, narrative: { text: "nope" })  # ~> GivenNotMet: the balance covers it
Banking::Account.find(account.id).balance.to_h  # => { cents: 300, currency: "USD" }
```
