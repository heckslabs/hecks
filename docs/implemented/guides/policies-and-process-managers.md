# Policies and process managers

A command answers a synchronous caller directly. Much of what a real
system does is not synchronous — a payment gateway's webhook fires, a
scheduled payment's presentment gets declined at the far end, and
nothing is waiting for a direct answer. Something inside the domain
still has to react, and the reaction is a domain decision, not
infrastructure. `policy` is the seam where a fact that already happened
becomes that decision: not a script, not a callback bolted onto an
event bus, a declared reaction the runtime fires and records the
outcome of, the same way it records everything else. `process_manager`
is the seam for the reaction that cannot finish in one step — money
that has to leave one account before it can arrive at another, with a
real chance of failing partway through.

Both are provable against the real corpus, not a small domain invented
to order. `examples/banking/bluebook/` already carries
one of each shape this page teaches: a policy that reacts inside its
own domain, one that reaches across into another, one that re-triggers
itself on a bounded retry, and two sagas that coordinate a multi-step
change — one that undoes what it started when the second step refuses,
and one that has nothing to undo because nothing was ever created in
the first place.

## The shape of a reaction

`ScheduledPayment` holds the clearest example of a policy actually
closing a loop — a payment retries its own failed presentment, up to
the limit the schedule names, exactly as it reads in the real file:

```ruby skip
# ScheduledPayment, in examples/banking/bluebook/
command "Fail" do
  role "System"
  goal "Record that today's presentment could not be collected"

  reference_to ScheduledPayment

  emits "ScheduledPaymentFailed"
end

# SELF-TRIGGERING, ON PURPOSE — the same shape reflex.bluebook's Echo/Ring
# proves MAX_REACTION_DEPTH with, grounded in a real rule instead of an
# unbounded ring: an automated re-presentment against an account still
# short of funds fails for the identical reason, so it re-announces the
# identical event, and `RetryOnPaymentFailure` below re-enters this same
# command. `given` is the REAL bound a bank actually enforces — a
# schedule's own `max_attempts`, ordinarily well inside the runtime's
# five-deep reaction ceiling, which exists as the backstop under
# whatever a caller configures it to, not as this policy's normal exit.
#
# MUTATING, NOT CREATING — same reason Echo.Ring is: the reaction
# re-dispatches this against the SAME record every time it re-enters,
# and a creating command now refuses a second creation over one
# identity (AlreadyExists).
command "Retry" do
  role "System"
  goal "Re-present a failed payment, up to the limit the schedule names"

  reference_to ScheduledPayment

  given("a retry is still allowed") { attempts.value < max_attempts.value }

  sets :attempts, increment: { value: 1 }

  ensures("a retry never lowers the attempt count") { attempts.value == old.attempts.value + 1 }

  emits "ScheduledPaymentFailed"
end

policy "RetryOnPaymentFailure" do
  on      "ScheduledPayment.ScheduledPaymentFailed"
  trigger ScheduledPayment::Retry
end
```

Read the keyword off that block: `policy` is three lines, `on` names
the event, `trigger` names the command it fires, and that is the whole
of it — no condition of its own, because the condition already ran on
the way in (the `given`s on the command it triggers) and the `on` event
is already a committed fact. `Fail` and `Retry` both emit the identical
event name, `ScheduledPaymentFailed`, which is the entire mechanism:
nothing about `policy` cares whether the event it watches for came from
the command that first failed a payment or from a retry re-announcing
the same failure.

## Wiring

```ruby boot
Hecks::Adapters::Folder.new.load_bluebooks(File.join(InMemoryDomain::ROOT, "examples/banking/bluebook"))

Hecks.hecksagon("Banking") do
  uses_framework "Governance"
  Banking::Customer.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::Account.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::ScheduledPayment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::Transfer.persisted_by("Memory")
  Banking::OnboardingCase.persisted_by("Memory")
end
Hecks.hecksagon("Governance") do
  Governance::RoleAssignment.persisted_by("Memory")
  Governance::RoleTransition.persisted_by("Memory")
end
```

## A policy firing, self-triggering and all

A scheduled payment needs an account to stand against:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c3" },
                  name: { given: "Kofi", family: "Mensah" }, email: { address: "kofi@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c3", number: { value: "a3" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 50_000 })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::ScheduledPayment.Schedule", account: "a3",
                  instruction: { value: "instr1" }, amount: { cents: 500 },
                  recipient: { value: "Landlord Realty" }, due_on: { value: "2026-09-01" })

Banking::ScheduledPayment.find("instr1").attempts.to_h      # => { value: 0 }
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find("instr1").max_attempts.to_h  # => { value: 3 }
```

`Schedule` names no `max_attempts` of its own — there is no argument
for it — so every schedule in this domain gets `RetryLimit`'s declared
default, 3. Fail the presentment once, and watch what one dispatch
actually does:

```ruby
before = runtime.reactions.size
runtime.dispatch("Banking::ScheduledPayment.Fail", instruction: "instr1")
cascade = runtime.reactions[before..]

cascade.size  # => 4
```

One call to `Fail` produced four reactions, not one — `Fail` emitted
`ScheduledPaymentFailed`, `RetryOnPaymentFailure` matched it and
dispatched `Retry`, `Retry`'s own mutation succeeded and emitted
`ScheduledPaymentFailed` again, and the policy matched its own
trigger's output a second time, and a third, before the schedule's
`given` finally had something to say:

```ruby
cascade.count { |r| r[:delivered] == true }                # => 3
cascade.count { |r| r[:delivered] == false }                # => 1
cascade.find { |r| r[:delivered] == false }[:reason]  # => "Retry refused — a retry is still allowed"
```

`delivered: true` three times because `Retry` accepted the call while
`attempts` still read below `max_attempts` — 0, then 1, then 2. The
fourth attempt found `attempts.value == 3`, `given("a retry is still
allowed")` came back false, and `react` recorded the refusal instead of
letting it fly, the same way it would for any command a policy's
trigger reaches: `GivenNotMet` and the rest of the refusal family are
caught and written down; a real defect — a typo in a `trigger`, an
argument the event never carries — is not, and reaches you the way any
other bug would. What is left standing:

```ruby
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find("instr1").status         # => "failed"
Banking::ScheduledPayment.find("instr1").attempts.to_h  # => { value: 3 }
```

Three real attempts, recorded on the record itself, and a `status` that
never left `"failed"` — `Retry`'s own lifecycle transition is `"Retry"
=> "failed", from: "failed"`, so a successful retry is still a failure
until someone dispatches something else.

## The reaction depth limit

Nothing about `policy`'s declaration proves this loop terminates — a
policy is not required to prove that, any more than a `given` is
required to prove anything about the commands it unblocks later. What
actually stopped this one was `given("a retry is still allowed")`, a
fact about a specific schedule's `max_attempts`, not the runtime
stepping in. The runtime's own backstop sits well outside where this
example ever reached it:

```ruby
Hecks::Runtime::Dispatcher::MAX_REACTION_DEPTH  # => 5
```

Four reactions from one `Fail` is comfortably inside five, and there is
currently no command on `ScheduledPayment` that lets a caller raise
`max_attempts` past it — every schedule in this domain retries at most
three times before `Abandon` is the only way forward. A policy that
genuinely never stopped — the same shape `RetryOnPaymentFailure`
carries, minus the `given` that bounds it — would instead run into
`Dispatcher::MAX_REACTION_DEPTH` itself: the reaction that would be the
sixth in a chain is refused with `reaction depth 5 reached` instead of
firing, and everything dispatched before it stands as it was. That is
proved directly, on a fixture built for nothing else, by this repo's
own dispatcher tests (`spec/fixtures/reflex.bluebook`) — not
reproduced here, because banking's own retry never needs it: the
business rule that bounds a real retry is also the one you would
want to hit first, in production, before a ceiling built to catch a bug
ever has to.

## When the event's shape and the trigger's don't agree

By default a policy forwards the event's WHOLE payload as the trigger's
arguments, verbatim — not reshaped, not filtered — so unless you say
otherwise, the event's shape and the trigger's argument shape have to
agree before either is written.

Banking's own corpus shows what that costs when they don't.
`Customer.Suspend` emits `CustomerSuspended` carrying its own two
arguments — the customer's reference and the `standing` it was
suspended with — and the policy reacting to it triggers
`Account.FreezeAccount`, which has no use for either. Forwarded whole,
`FreezeAccount` would have to declare a `standing` it never reads just
to be reachable, and `Account` would need a value object declared
solely to type it.

`with:` is how a trigger says what it actually needs — the same
`key => value` shape a saga's own `dispatch ..., with:` takes, and read
the same way: a Symbol names a field on the source, anything else is a
literal the policy supplies itself.

```ruby skip
# Banking, top level, in examples/banking/bluebook/
policy "FreezeAccountsOnSuspension" do
  on       "CustomerSuspended"
  for_each "Account.OpenForCustomer"
  trigger  Account::FreezeAccount, with: { account: :account }
end
```

`account` is the key the fan-out merges for each row it answers. The row
is part of the source a projection reads from, not something bolted on
afterwards — which is what lets a trigger be given the record it acts on
and nothing else.

The other half is `for_each`. `CustomerSuspended` names a CUSTOMER, and
a customer may hold several accounts — nothing in the event says which
one to freeze, or how many. Without the fan-out there is no account for
the trigger to address at all, which is why this policy sat in the
corpus for a long time never once firing. With it, one suspension
reaches every open account that customer holds:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c2" },
                  name: { given: "Nadia", family: "Osei" }, email: { address: "nadia@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c2", number: { value: "sus-1" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 50_000 })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c2", number: { value: "sus-2" },
                  kind: { name: "savings" }, daily_limit: { cents: 10_000 })

before = runtime.reactions.size
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Suspend", reference: "c2", standing: { value: "under review" })

# Filtered by policy: each freeze this one causes goes on to fire
# `ReviewOnFreeze` in its own right, so the log carries those too.
froze = runtime.reactions[before..].select { |row| row[:policy] == "FreezeAccountsOnSuspension" }
froze.map { |row| row[:for_row] }  # => ["sus-1", "sus-2"]
froze.map { |row| row[:delivered] }.uniq  # => [true]
```

Both accounts moved, and nothing at the call site named either of them:

```ruby
Banking::Customer.find("c2").status  # => "suspended"
Banking::Account.find("sus-1").status  # => "frozen"
Banking::Account.find("sus-2").status  # => "frozen"
```

Get the shapes to agree — a lean port or event carrying only what its
trigger needs — and this class of bug has nowhere left to hide; get
them wrong and the reaction dies as `UnknownArgument` or
`AbsentArgument` on every single delivery, recorded in the reaction log
and nowhere a caller will look. Which is why an external fact belongs
on a narrow, purpose-built event rather than one bookkeeping-heavy
enough to drift from what reacts to it.

## Reaching across domains

A policy does not care where it was written. One declared inside
`aggregate "ScheduledPayment"` and one declared at the bluebook's top
level — banking's corpus has both, and you have already seen one of
each — behave identically at runtime; `on`'s event name is all the
interpreter reads. And when the command a policy triggers lives in a
different domain entirely, `across` names it:

```ruby skip
# Account, in examples/banking/bluebook/
policy "ReviewOnFreeze" do
  on      "Account.AccountFrozen"
  trigger AccountFreezeReview::Open
  across  "Compliance"
end
```

Banking's own `Compliance` domain is real — its own standalone
deployment, `examples/compliance` — but this guide never loads it, and
that is itself worth seeing, because `across` does not pretend
otherwise. Open an account, freeze it, and the policy still fires,
reaching for a domain that genuinely is not loaded HERE:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c1" },
                  name: { given: "Théo", family: "Lindqvist" }, email: { address: "theo@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c1", number: { value: "a1" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 50_000 })

before = runtime.reactions.size
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.FreezeAccount", number: "a1")
runtime.reactions[before..].size     # => 1
runtime.reactions.last[:trigger]     # => "Compliance::AccountFreezeReview.Open"
runtime.reactions.last[:delivered]   # => false
runtime.reactions.last[:reason]      # => "no domain \"Compliance\" loaded (verb Compliance::AccountFreezeReview.Open)"

Banking::Account.find("a1").status   # => "frozen"
```

`Freeze` itself is untouched by any of this — the account is frozen
either way, because a policy reacts to a committed fact and cannot
un-commit it. What `across` buys you the moment `Compliance` IS loaded
in the same process is a real cross-domain dispatch, recorded the same
way; what it buys you here, with `Compliance` absent, is a named
refusal instead of a silent no-op or a crash — `runtime.reactions`
tells you exactly which domain a policy reached for and did not find,
which is the difference between a page you can debug from its own log
and one where a reaction just quietly never happened.

## `process_manager` — a conversation with real state

A policy answers one event with one trigger. `Settlement` answers a
question a policy cannot: a transfer has to leave the source account
before it can arrive at the destination, and something has to remember
which conversation a later event belongs to.

```ruby skip
# Banking, top level, in examples/banking/bluebook/
process_manager "Settlement" do
  # THE FIELD, NAMED — Transfer.Request declares `attribute :reference,
  # TransferReference`, which is also what Transfer's own `identified_by
  # :reference` derives its id from, so this reads the exact same scalar
  # the old bare `:transfer` reached only by coincidence (the aggregate's
  # own reference key happening to spell the same as the correlation
  # name). Named, not guessed.
  correlates_by :"reference.value"
  starts_on "TransferRequested"
  ends_on   "TransferSettled"

  # ONE STATE-MACHINE VOCABULARY (S7, ADR 0025) — the SAME word
  # `lifecycle`'s own `transition` already carries, one level over;
  # `state "x"` lines are gone, since every state here is already
  # named by some transition's own `from:`/target — declaring them
  # again said nothing the transitions below didn't already say.
  transition "TransferRequested" => "requested", from: "requested" do
    # `compensates` — PER-DISPATCH SAGA COMPENSATION, one leg at a time,
    # replacing a hand-written list at the bottom of this saga (see
    # "Compensation," below, for the real bug this closes).
    dispatch Account::Debit, with: { number: :source, amount: :amount, narrative: { text: "transfer out" }, reference: :reference } do
      compensates Account::Credit, with: { number: :source, amount: :amount, narrative: { text: "transfer reversed" } }
    end
  end

  transition "AccountDebited" => "awaiting_credit", from: "requested" do
    dispatch Transfer::Debited, with: { transfer: :reference }
    dispatch Account::Credit, with: { number: :destination, amount: :amount, narrative: { text: "transfer in" }, reference: :reference }
  end

  transition "AccountCredited" => "awaiting_credit", from: "awaiting_credit" do
    dispatch Transfer::Credited, with: { transfer: :reference }
  end

  transition "TransferCredited" => "settled", from: "awaiting_credit" do
    dispatch Transfer::Settle, with: { transfer: :reference }
  end

  # `Transfer::Reverse` stays hand-written — it marks the TRANSFER
  # reversed, unconditionally, not one dispatch's own effect, so it is
  # not a `compensates` candidate; see "Compensation," below.
  transition :refused => "reversed", from: "awaiting_credit" do
    dispatch Transfer::Reverse, with: { transfer: :reference }
  end
end
```

`correlates_by` says which conversation an event belongs to — always a
dotted path to one scalar, never a bare value object, for the same
reason `identified_by :reference` already holds `Transfer`'s
own identity to: a value object has no single unambiguous rendering to
key on. `starts_on`/`ends_on` bound the conversation; `transition` is
the SAME word `lifecycle`'s own `transition` already carries one level
over — `"EventType" => "to_state", from: "from_state"`, differing only
in what triggers it (a command there, an event here) — and each block
is one leg: an event that must arrive while the instance is in `from:`
before the saga dispatches whatever that leg does next and moves it to
the state named. `state "x"` lines don't exist any more — every state a
saga can be in is derived from the transitions that name it, first-seen
order, the same way an aggregate's own lifecycle states already are.
`from:` is mandatory here, unlike `Lifecycle#transition`'s own optional
`from:` — a saga's admission check tests a running instance's current
state by plain equality, with no "matches any state" fallback, so a
transition naming no `from:` is refused at declaration rather than
silently matching nothing at runtime.

Open two accounts under one customer, fund the source, and ask for a
transfer between them:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c4" },
                  name: { given: "Rosa", family: "Klein" }, email: { address: "rosa@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c4", number: { value: "src1" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 100_000 })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c4", number: { value: "dst1" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 100_000 })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Credit", number: "src1", amount: { cents: 1000 }, narrative: { text: "opening balance" })

runtime.dispatch("Banking::Transfer.Request", reference: { value: "tr1" }, amount: { cents: 200 },
                  narrative: { text: "rent" }, source: "src1", destination: "dst1")

Banking::Account.find("src1").balance.to_h  # => { cents: 800, currency: "USD" }
Banking::Account.find("dst1").balance.to_h  # => { cents: 200, currency: "USD" }
Banking::Transfer.find("tr1").status        # => "settled"
```

Nobody dispatched `Debit`, `Debited`, `Credit`, `Credited`, or `Settle`
directly — `Settlement` did, one leg at a time, exactly as its handlers
declare, ending on `TransferSettled`, which is also `ends_on` — the
instance closes there and stops being tracked:

```ruby
runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "tr1" && s[:ended] }
# => [{ process_manager: "Settlement", on: "TransferSettled", instance: "tr1", ended: true }]

runtime.registry.saga_instances["Settlement"].key?("tr1")  # => false
```

## Compensation — the refused leg

Freeze the destination before asking for a second transfer, and the
`Credit` leg refuses partway through — after the money already left the
source:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c5" },
                  name: { given: "Iris", family: "Falk" }, email: { address: "iris@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c5", number: { value: "src2" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 100_000 })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Open", customer: "c5", number: { value: "dst2" },
                  kind: { name: "current" }, daily_limit: { cents: 100_000 })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.Credit", number: "src2", amount: { cents: 1000 }, narrative: { text: "opening balance" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Account.FreezeAccount", number: "dst2")

runtime.dispatch("Banking::Transfer.Request", reference: { value: "tr2" }, amount: { cents: 200 },
                  narrative: { text: "rent" }, source: "src2", destination: "dst2")

Banking::Account.find("src2").balance.to_h  # => { cents: 1000, currency: "USD" }
Banking::Transfer.find("tr2").status        # => "reversed"
```

1000, not 800 — the money is back where it started, because a refused
leg unwinds on its own. Nobody dispatched `Reverse` by hand, and nobody
had to notice the transfer had stalled: `Account.Debit`'s own `compensates
Account::Credit` is what actually restores the balance here — the
runtime tracks which of THIS instance's own dispatches completed
(`Account.Debit` did; `Account.Credit` is the one that refused, so it
has nothing of its own to undo) and, the moment the refusal hits
`transition :refused => "reversed", from: "awaiting_credit"`, dispatches
every completed leg's own `compensates` first, newest first, THEN this
leg's own hand-written `Transfer.Reverse` — coexistence, not
replacement: marking the transfer itself reversed is not any ONE
dispatch's own undo, it is a fact this saga needs unconditionally
whenever a refusal lands here. Read the saga log and the refusal, the
derived compensation, and the hand-written mark are all right there,
not swallowed:

```ruby
refused = runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "tr2" && s[:delivered] == false }
refused.map { |s| s[:reason] }  # => ["Credit refused — status is \"frozen\", and Credit moves it only from \"open\""]

derived = runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "tr2" && s[:compensation] }
derived.map { |s| [s[:dispatch], s[:delivered]] }  # => [["Account.Credit", true]]

runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "tr2" && s[:dispatch] == "Transfer.Reverse" }.map { |s| s[:delivered] }  # => [true]
```

Only ONE compensation is DERIVED — `Account.Debit`'s own `Account.Credit` —
never `Account.Credit`'s own effect, because that leg is the one that
refused; it never completed, so it never joined the ledger of what to
undo. This is exactly the shape a single hand-written list at the
bottom of the saga could not express correctly in general: it has no
way to know WHICH legs actually ran before a refusal, only what the
author guessed would always be true — `Transfer.Reverse` alone, staying
hand-written, is what the ORIGINAL list should have been all along; the
money movement is what actually needed per-leg tracking.

Without this compensation, a refusal like this would leave the money
gone from the source, credited nowhere, until a human noticed the
stalled transfer and corrected it by hand — and this saga's own history
says exactly this happened once: the compensating leg used to hang off
`"TransferReversed"`, an event only a human dispatching
`Transfer.Reverse` by hand would ever produce, so the reversal was
written and never armed. `:refused` is a refusal, not an event any
command emits, which is why the leg still answers it by name rather
than by an `on` string nothing announces — only WHERE its own
dispatches come from changed, not the trigger itself.

**"Nobody had to notice" is a claim about a *refusal*, not about a
crash.** Everything above happens inside one dispatch, one process,
with nothing killed in between — `Account.Credit` declines, and
`unwind` runs in the same call stack that asked for the credit. A
process that dies partway through is a different case, and there are
two windows. **Between the triggering command's commit and its
reactions:** the transactional outbox (`Runtime::Outbox`, ADR 0053)
closes this one. On Sqlite/Postgres/PostgresEra, the command's save,
its event, and one `pending` row per consumer — every policy that
would fire, every process manager that would begin, advance or end on
the event — commit in ONE transaction; the dispatcher then claims and
delivers each row inline. A crash before delivery leaves the row
`pending`, and the next boot redrives it (its consumer provably never
started). A crash *inside* a consumer leaves it `claimed`; the next
boot warns (`[hecks] outbox row ... claimed before the last crash ...`)
and leaves it for `runtime.outbox.redrive!(claimed: true)` — never an
automatic retry, because redelivering a dispatch whose outcome is
genuinely unknown risks a double-credited transfer, a strictly worse
defect than the stall. **Between a saga's checkpoint and its own leg's
dispatch:** the checkpoint commits the new state before that leg's
dispatch runs (the mutex guarding the checkpoint can't be held across
a dispatch that might re-enter it), so a crash there leaves a state on
record with no proof its leg ran. Booting against the same durable
adapter surfaces it — a loud `[hecks] ... rehydrated ... with a
dispatch left pending ...` warning and a `rehydrated_stalled: true`
entry in `runtime.sagas` — and, for the same reason as a `claimed`
outbox row, does not auto-redrive it. Both windows are now visible
across a restart; the second, like a `claimed` row, still needs a
human to look and decide.

## When there is nothing to compensate

`Settlement` compensates because a transfer stopped halfway is money
unaccounted for — something must be put back. `Onboarding`, banking's
newest saga, does not, and its own comment says exactly why:

```ruby skip
# Banking, top level, in examples/banking/bluebook/

# THE FIRST SAGA THAT DOES NOT COMPENSATE. Settlement and ExternalSettlement
# both carry an `on :refused` leg because a transfer stopped halfway is
# money unaccounted for — something must be put back. A KYC case that does
# not clear has nothing to put back: no account was ever opened and no
# money ever moved, so Decline is simply where the flow stops. There is no
# `on :refused` leg here — compare its shape against Settlement's above
# rather than trusting the claim.
process_manager "Onboarding" do
  correlates_by :"reference.value"
  starts_on "OnboardingOpened"
  ends_on   "AccountOpened"

  transition "OnboardingCleared" => "cleared", from: "screening" do
    dispatch Account::Open, with: {
      customer:    :customer,
      number:      :account_number,
      kind:        { name: "current" },
      daily_limit: { cents: 0 }
    }
  end

  # THE NON-COMPENSATING LEG — no dispatch, because nothing was ever
  # created to undo.
  transition "OnboardingDeclined" => "declined", from: "screening"
end
```

Clear a case, and the saga does what `Settlement` does — dispatches the
one leg it owns and closes on `ends_on`:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c6" },
                  name: { given: "Salim", family: "Haddad" }, email: { address: "salim@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::OnboardingCase.Open", customer: "c6",
                  reference: { value: "ob1" }, account_number: { value: "acct1" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::OnboardingCase.Clear", reference: "ob1")

runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "ob1" && s[:ended] }
# => [{ process_manager: "Onboarding", on: "AccountOpened", instance: "ob1", ended: true }]

runtime.registry.saga_instances["Onboarding"].key?("ob1")  # => false
Banking::Account.find("acct1").status                      # => "open"
```

Decline one instead, and the saga's own log tells the rest of the
story on its own:

```ruby
runtime.dispatch("Banking::Customer.Register", reference: { value: "c7" },
                  name: { given: "Priya", family: "Nair" }, email: { address: "priya@example.com" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::OnboardingCase.Open", customer: "c7",
                  reference: { value: "ob2" }, account_number: { value: "acct2" })
runtime.dispatch("Banking::OnboardingCase.Decline", reference: "ob2")

runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "ob2" }.size  # => 2
runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "ob2" && s.key?(:dispatch) }  # => []

Banking::OnboardingCase.find("ob2").status  # => "declined"
Banking::Account.find("acct2")              # => nil
```

Two log entries — the saga being born, and the one transition to
`"declined"` — and neither one is a `dispatch`, because `transition
"OnboardingDeclined" => "declined"` names no block at all. No account was minted for
`"acct2"` because nothing ever asked for one. And notice what did NOT
happen: `runtime.registry.saga_instances["Onboarding"]` still holds
`"ob2"` —

```ruby
runtime.registry.saga_instances["Onboarding"].key?("ob2")  # => true
```

— because `ends_on` names `"AccountOpened"`, and a declined case never
emits it. `"declined"` is a real, terminal state as far as the KYC case
itself is concerned, but the SAGA's own bookkeeping only closes on the
event it was told to end on — a distinction worth knowing before you
assume every saga that reaches a natural stopping point also stops
being tracked.

## When a leg can't be delivered at all

Everything above unwinds because the DOMAIN refused a leg — `given` said no,
a lifecycle move wasn't admitted, `Credit` declined. Two other ways a leg
can fail to run are not domain decisions at all, and this saga's own
runtime treats them differently from each other.

Hitting `Dispatcher::MAX_REACTION_DEPTH` (the reaction depth limit,
above) mid-saga isn't a decision either, but there's nothing ambiguous
about it — the leg unambiguously did not run — so it unwinds on the spot,
the same `on :refused` leg a real refusal triggers, no retry involved:

```ruby skip
cascade = runtime.sagas.select { |s| s[:instance] == "tr9" }
cascade.find { |s| s[:reason] == "reaction depth 5 reached" }
# => { process_manager: "Settlement", instance: "tr9", dispatch: "Banking::Account.Credit",
#      delivered: false, reason: "reaction depth 5 reached" }
```

A genuine crash — a `NoMethodError`, a `NameError` from a typo in a
`dispatch`'s argument mapping — is the one case that's actually ambiguous:
it might be a real bug (retrying changes nothing) or it might be
transient (a DB timeout, a race, a cold start — retrying clears it). So it
gets `SagaInterpreter::MAX_DEFECT_RETRIES` attempts at the identical
dispatch before the saga treats it as something to compensate for. Every
attempt is logged (`defect: true`, `retrying: true`); only the last one,
once retries are exhausted, unwinds — and it's tagged
`defect_compensated: true` rather than folded into an ordinary refusal's
shape, so the log never claims the domain decided something it didn't:

```ruby skip
cascade.select { |s| s[:defect] }.map { |s| s.values_at(:attempt, :retrying, :defect_compensated) }
# => [[1, true, nil], [2, true, nil], [3, true, nil], [4, nil, true]]
```

Both paths still leave the ORIGINAL triggering command's own success
standing — same as an ordinary defect always has — the only thing new is
that the saga no longer just logs a defect and waits for a human to find
it; it puts back what it can and moves on.

## What `bin/model_check` still catches here

Every policy and every process manager here is data, the same data the
runtime dispatches against, which means the checker `verification.md`
covers in depth can walk it with nothing booted. Four of its finding
kinds are specific to this page's own vocabulary: `deaf_trigger` (a
saga's `starts_on`/`ends_on` names an event nothing emits),
`unreachable_pm_state` (a declared saga state no handler chain ever
reaches), `dead_compensation` (a compensation's own `from_state` no
handler chain ever reaches), and `deaf_policy` / `unknown_trigger` (a
policy's `on` or `trigger` naming something that isn't there). Run it
against the same domain this page just walked:

```ruby
require "hecks/bluebook/model_check"

findings = Hecks::Bluebook::ModelCheck.call(runtime.registry.bluebook("Banking"))
errors = findings.select { |f| f.severity == :error }

errors.size  # => 0
```

Zero, and `ModelCheck::ALLOWED_FINDINGS` is empty too — not because
nobody looked, but because a finding this checker used to allowlist on
purpose stopped being possible. `ExternalSettlement` used to declare a
`state "sent"` line no handler's own `from:`/target ever named — a pure
declaration-drift artifact, the SAGA's own bookkeeping never closing on
a state its own protocol never reached, even though the underlying
transfer genuinely sends. Since `transition` (the one word this page
now uses throughout) DERIVES a saga's states from the transitions that
name them, the same way an aggregate's own lifecycle states already
are, there is no longer a way to declare a state and then forget to
wire a handler that reaches it — the finding this used to catch cannot
occur any more, by construction, so `verification.md`'s own allowlist
has nothing left to name.
