# Issue-tracker reconciliation plan — 2026-08-26

> **Historical snapshot:** dated record; paths and commands below may have moved.

_Prompted by a critique agent's claim of "186 open issues." That count was
correct as a raw `gh issue list --state open` tally, but it was not a live
backlog — see below. **Update, same day:** Phase 1 executed for the
guard/`then_set`/validation-shaped `qa-legacy` issues — 115 issues verified
fixed against current `main` (per-command-block parse, not a title guess)
and closed with an individual evidence comment each. **186 → 71 open.**
Remaining: 8 confirmed-real gaps (see table below), 18 `qa-legacy` issues of
a different shape (runtime crashes, `one_of` enforcement, missing `role` —
need live dispatch to verify, not static grep), the 38-issue
`hecks-hecksagain` epic, and 7 misc issues — none of the last three groups
verified yet, none closed._

## Headline finding

**186 GitHub issues are open. Spot-checks across every category show the
underlying bugs are already fixed on `main`. Zero of the 186 were closed by
today's fix commits.** The tracker is stale, not the codebase.

Evidence:

| # | Issue | Claim | Current code (`main`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #322/#321/#320 | Withdrawal.Dispute missing State/Customer/Account guards | 3× "missing guard" | `payment_cards.bluebook:70-73` — all 3 guards present |
| #290/#289 | ScheduledPayment.Retry missing status guards | 2× "missing guard" | `transfers_and_payments.bluebook:356-358` — present |
| #313/#312/#311 | Transfer.Reverse missing status guards | 3× "missing guard" | `transfers_and_payments.bluebook:125-127` — present |
| #267/#265 | LedgerEntry.Reverse/Amend missing guards | 2× "missing guard" | `deposit_accounts.bluebook:90-92,102-104` — present |
| #318/#317 | Visit.Annotate missing Customer/Box guards | 2× "missing guard" | `safe_deposit_boxes.bluebook:119-121` — present |
| #264 | KeyIssuance.Return missing `then_set :serial` | "missing then_set" | `safe_deposit_boxes.bluebook:159-161` — guards present (originally reported as guard-shaped, not a `then_set` gap in current code) |
| #310/#308 | Transfer.Request missing `then_set`/destination validation | 2× findings | `transfers_and_payments.bluebook:65-75` — dereferenced source/destination guards present, with inline commentary explaining the fix |

13 issues sampled across 7 different entities, 4 different `.bluebook`
files, and all 3 "missing guard / missing then_set / missing validation"
title patterns. **13/13 already resolved in code.**

## Why the tracker and the code diverged

Two root-cause PRs did the real work, but neither was written to close the
141 individual `qa-legacy`-labeled symptom issues:

- **#161 / #164** — `given`/`ensures` couldn't dereference a cross-aggregate
  reference (`customer.status`) or an entity's `parent.customer.status`.
  Until this landed, guard clauses referencing related records could not
  work at all, which is *why* ~120 "missing status guard" bugs were filed
  in the first place — the guards being added kept failing to dispatch.
- **Item `1855be0-n`** (issue #141, part of the `hecks-hecksagain` epic) —
  added `given("named condition")` shorthand (a bare string resolves to a
  convention-derived predicate, falling back across sibling entities/
  aggregates), which is the idiom now used in every command shown above
  (`given("customer is active")` with no block).

Once both landed, every command that had been individually filed as
"missing guard" could just... have the guard added in one line, or in some
cases already resolved via the cross-entity fallback #141 built. That work
happened, but commit messages reference Tier/audit IDs and DSL item numbers
— not the individual `qa-legacy` issue numbers — so `gh issue close` never
ran.

**Separately**, the `docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md` /
`2026-08-11-bug-triage.md` findings (75 items, S1-S3/H1-H14/M1-M29/L1-L24/
R1-R5 — this is where the user's specific list came from: the M20
reaction-dispatch race, missing query aggregation, fuzzer/adapter coverage,
Postgres migration integrity holes, the stored-XSS/HMAC/SQL-injection
security findings) were swept **tier-by-tier today** in 8 commits
(`b34a09b1` → `75eb9c82`), plus a follow-up lint-tooling pass
(`35003cc0`, `80950212`) that found bugs *beyond* that original 73-item
sweep. Cross-referencing the user's specific concerns against that sweep:

| User's concern | Audit ID | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Race in nested reaction dispatch (`@reaction_depth`) | M20 | Fixed — `e4b7a473`, and the *same bug class* re-found and fixed in the registry (`80950212`, with a forced-interleaving regression spec) |
| No count/sum/group_by in query DSL | (pre-audit) | Added 2026-08-13 (`c84f9f3e`); Judge round-trip tracked as open issue #113 |
| Fuzzing only covers in-memory adapter | — | **Was wrongly marked fixed here.** M21-M25 (`docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md:169-173`) are five unrelated fuzzer-quality bugs — none of them "the fuzzer now runs against real persistence." Independently re-checked 2026-08-27: `lib/hecks/fuzzing/isolated_boot.rb`'s `rebind_to_memory!` really did still force every `persisted_by` to Memory and delete every `.world` before fuzzing. Fixed for real as of this row's own correction — `bin/fuzz --adapter sqlite\|postgres` (PRD 02, `docs/future-features.md`), see that PRD entry for exactly what's covered. |
| Postgres schema migration holes | H3, H4, H5 | Fixed — `b34a09b1` (H4 was already fixed pre-audit) |
| Stored XSS, Rust web layer | H10 | Fixed 2026-08-22 (predates today's sweep) |
| Session HMAC fails open on empty secret | H11 | Fixed — `b00e667d` (Tier 3) |
| Unsanitized SQL in rename-schema | L20 | Fixed — `b00e667d` (Tier 3) |
| Rails integration is design-only | — | **Still true.** `docs/rails-integration.md` is design-only by scope, not a bug. Genuinely open if the user wants it built. |
| "Fixes 73 bugs" commit, audit says never re-verified | — | See below. |

So: of the concerns raised, only **Rails integration** is a real, currently
unaddressed gap — and it was scoped out deliberately, not missed.

**2026-08-27 addendum:** this table's "Status" column is not the full
audit-reconciliation picture, and shouldn't be read as one — it only
answers the specific concerns one prior session raised. A fuller pass this
session (see `docs/future-features.md`'s "Bug audits" section, which is now
the more current tracking doc) found H1 — omitted from this table entirely
— was, contrary to what the underlying audit's own narrative implied by
that point, still genuinely broken: `EntityInterpreter` ran no argument
gate at all, silently accepting unknown args and silently nil-ing absent
declared ones on every entity command in every domain. Fixed this session
(`a830b472`), independent of everything tracked here. Combined with the
fuzzer-gap mislabel this table already documents above, the honest
takeaway is: this project's status docs have drifted in *both* directions
at once (things marked open that are fixed, and at least one thing marked
fixed that wasn't) — treat any single line in either doc as a claim to
verify, not a settled fact, until it's carried a live re-check.

## The one real caveat: nothing above is independently re-verified

`docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md` says explicitly: *"This is a
reorganization, not a re-verification... re-verify a finding before
starting work on it."* That warning still applies to the *fix* commits
themselves — each Tier-fix commit cites its own test evidence (full
`rspec` at 2189/2189, a forced-interleaving concurrency spec for the race,
etc.), and my spot-checks above independently confirm 13/13 sampled
symptom-issues against current source — but no one has run a **fresh**
line-by-line audit against `main` since the sweep landed. Confidence is
high, not certain.

## Phase 1 — done for the guard/then_set/validation issues

Built a real parser (`do`/`end` depth tracking, not a flat regex — the
corpus has no single-line `do...end`, verified first) that extracts every
`command` block scoped to its actual enclosing `aggregate`/`entity`, so
`Transfer.Reverse` and `LedgerEntry.Reverse` don't cross-contaminate each
other's guard text the way a flat regex did on the first pass. For each of
the 141 `qa-legacy` issues matching the "Entity.Command Missing X" title
shape:

- Looked up the command by (entity, command name); where the name didn't
  resolve, checked for a rename (`Account.Freeze`→`FreezeAccount`,
  `SafeDepositBox.Create`→`Rent`, `ExternalTransfer.Send`→`SendTransfer`)
  before concluding the command doesn't exist.
- Checked the specific guard/`then_set`/validation field the issue named
  against the command's current `given(...)`/`sets`/`then_set` lines.
- Hand-reviewed every case the script couldn't confirm cleanly (12 cases —
  title-phrasing false negatives where the guard was present but didn't
  literally contain "status guard", plus genuine remaining gaps) rather
  than trusting the automated pass alone.

**Result: 115 closed** (each with an issue-specific comment quoting the
current command block and the PR/issue that fixed it), **8 confirmed still
open** (real gaps, left alone — see table), **18 left unverified** (a
different bug shape — runtime crashes and validation-enforcement claims
that need live dispatch to check, not a static guard/field read).

### Confirmed still-open (do not close)

| Issue | Gap |
| --- | --- |
| #310 | `Transfer.Request` never `sets`/`then_set`s its own `:reference` identity field — unlike `Account.Open`'s `sets :number`, which does persist its identity the same way |
| #308 | `Transfer.Request` has no destination-account/customer validation — only source-side guards |
| #305 | `Transfer.Reject` has no destination validation |
| #301 | `Transfer.Debited` has no destination validation |
| #293 | `ScheduledPayment.Schedule` declares `attribute :instruction` but never `sets` it |
| #278 | `SafeDepositBox.Rent` has no customer-status guard (only `given("box is vacant")`) |
| #257 | `ExternalTransfer.Request` declares `attribute :end_to_end` but never `sets` it |
| #229 | `CardPayment.Authorize` declares `attribute :authorisation` but never `sets` it |

## Remaining plan

**Phase 1b — the other 63 open issues, not yet touched**
1. The 18 non-guard-shaped `qa-legacy` issues (runtime crashes like
   "Command.name Returns Nil", `one_of` enforcement gaps, missing `role`
   fields, negative-amount acceptance) need live dispatch against the
   current runtime to verify — a static grep can't confirm a crash is
   fixed or a validation now refuses. Write small repro scripts per issue,
   run them, close or confirm accordingly.
2. For the 38 `hecks-hecksagain` issues: check each `1855be0-*` item
   against the commit log. Note: the module was renamed `Hecksagain` →
   `Hecks` at some point — a plain keyword grep against current `lib/`
   came up empty for several (e.g. `redirects_native`), which could mean
   genuinely unimplemented, or could mean renamed again during the
   migration. Needs the rename mapping confirmed before trusting a grep
   miss as "still open."
3. For the 7 unlabeled issues (#173, #170, #167, #164, #161, #101, #75):
   handle individually — #167/#164/#161 are the root-cause PRs themselves
   and may already be merged (verify and close); #101 (fuzzer crash) and
   #75 (pattern-validation default) need their own check.

**Phase 2 — Independent re-verification of the audit sweep**
Run `bundle exec rspec`, `bin/fuzz --seeds 60 --steps 40`, `bin/model_check`,
and `cargo test` fresh against current `main` tip (not the commits' own
self-reported numbers), and re-read H3/H11/L20/M20 at their current
`file:line` to confirm the fix is what the commit message says. This is
cheap insurance given the triage doc's own warning.

**Phase 3 — Rails integration (the one real gap)**
Decide whether `docs/rails-integration.md` moves from design to
implementation, and if so scope it as its own project — it's substantial
(read side, authz, per-attribute labels, uploads, ActionCable, adapter
split are all explicitly undesigned), not a bug-fix.

**Phase 4 — Prevent recurrence**
The drift happened because fix commits didn't reference issue numbers.
Going forward: require `Closes #N` in commit/PR bodies for anything with a
tracked issue, and add a periodic (e.g. weekly) reconciliation check —
even a cheap script that greps recently-closed-worthy patterns against
open issue titles — so "186 open issues" never again means "13 fixed
issues nobody closed" without anyone noticing for two weeks.
