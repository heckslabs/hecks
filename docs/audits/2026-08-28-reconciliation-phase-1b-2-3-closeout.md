# Reconciliation Phase 1b/2/3 closeout — 2026-08-28

> **Historical snapshot:** dated record; paths and commands below may have moved.

Live-verified against the current `main` tip (not trusted from prior session
notes) rather than assumed complete, per this project's own established
practice of treating status claims as claims to re-check, not settled facts.

## Headline finding

**0 open issues.** `gh issue list --repo heckslabs/hecks --state open`
returns nothing. 216 issues total, all closed. Every category the
reconciliation plan (`2026-08-26-issue-tracker-reconciliation-plan.md`)
named as unfinished — Phase 1b's 18 non-guard-shaped `qa-legacy` issues, the
38-issue `hecks-hecksagain` epic, and the 7 unlabeled misc issues — was
closed by other work in this repository's history before this session
picked the task back up. This closeout independently re-verified a sample
from each category rather than trusting the closed count at face value.

## Phase 1b — verified closed, sampled across every category

- **The 8 confirmed-real gaps** the plan's own table named still-open
  (#310, #308, #305, #301, #293, #278, #257, #229): all CLOSED, each with an
  evidence comment citing a real commit SHA and rspec/rubocop/fuzz results,
  or (for #308/#305/#301/#278) an explicit product decision recorded in
  `docs/audits/2026-08-26-open-bugs-catalog.md`.
- **The 18 non-guard-shaped `qa-legacy` issues** (runtime crashes, `one_of`
  enforcement, missing fields): sampled #199 ("Command.name Returns Nil")
  and #198 ("Compliance Domain Empty Bluebook Causes Fuzzer Crash") — both
  closed with live re-verification against current code (`hecks_name` vs.
  `name` accessor distinction; `bin/fuzz` running the compliance domain
  clean today), not a rubber-stamp close.
- **The 38-issue `hecks-hecksagain` epic** (`1855be0-*` items): all CLOSED —
  confirmed via `gh issue list --search "1855be0"` (25 results, all closed)
  and `--search "hecks-hecksagain"` (20 results, all closed, overlapping
  set). `docs/audits/2026-08-26-open-bugs-catalog.md` records the reasoning
  per group (already-fixed, won't-fix with a named reason, vendored code
  with no consumer, superseded by a sibling construct).
- **The 7 misc issues** (#173, #170, #167, #164, #161, #101, #75): a
  dedicated doc, `docs/audits/2026-08-26-issues-173-170-167-164-161-101-75.md`,
  covers each individually with file:line citations and its own fresh
  verification run (rspec 2195/2196, `bin/fuzz --seeds 20 --steps 30` clean,
  `cargo build --release` clean, against `main` tip `f0380b4a`).

`spec/word_coverage_spec.rb` and the S13 slice landed independently of this
issue-tracker reconciliation but touch the same underlying claim (every live
thing this project ships is real, not vestigial) — see `dsl-work-slices.md`'s
S13 row.

## Phase 2 — fresh independent re-verification, this session, this pass

Run today against the current `worktree-hecks-fixes` tip (post S12/S13,
merged with `main` through #423), not against any commit's own self-reported
numbers:

- `bundle exec rspec --tag '~io'` — 2280 examples, 0 failures.
- `bin/model_check` — 0 errors across every domain (`directory`, the newest
  corpus member, included).
- `bin/fuzz --seeds 60 --steps 40` — CLEAN across every fuzzable domain
  (banking, chess, compliance, pizzas, roster, deploy, framework, grammar,
  language, attaches, hecksagon, translation, world, fixtures,
  delegates_to, entity_list_mutations — `directory` correctly skipped, not
  fuzzable under `:memory` since it declares `compute`/`rekey`, which only
  an era/Postgres-bound boot can interpret).
- `cd rust && cargo test --lib` — 68 passed, 0 failed.
- Real `cargo build`, `parser_parity_spec` (39/39), `codegen_parity_spec`
  (8/8), `rust_conformance_spec --tag io` (14/22 — the same 14 pre-existing
  Rust-runtime-projection-gap scenarios as the established baseline, no new
  failures) — all already run and recorded in this session's S12/S13 merge
  work; not re-run a third time here since nothing changed since. **Update,
  2026-08-28, same day:** PR #433 closed that projection gap for real later
  the same day (`projects` fields now seeded at dispatch time in Rust too) —
  by the time of the 1.0.0 tag, `rust_conformance_spec` is 23/23, zero
  failures.

The audit-ID re-verification (H3/H11/L20/M20, M1-M19, L1-L24, Rust-parity
divergence list) this plan's own Phase 2 also named is tracked separately —
see the companion task for that specific pass, since it's a distinct body of
work from the issue-tracker reconciliation this doc covers.

## Phase 3 — Rails integration

Confirmed still design-only, and confirmed this is the correct, deliberate
state rather than an oversight: `docs/rails-integration.md`'s own header
states "Status: design only. Nothing in this document is built," and
`docs/audits/2026-08-26-open-bugs-catalog.md` already recorded this as the
one real, currently-unaddressed gap — scoped out on purpose, not missed.
No user request to build it landed in this session, so it stays scoped out.
If it becomes active work later, scope it as its own project per the
original plan's own Phase 3 text — it's substantial (read side, authz,
per-attribute labels, uploads, ActionCable, adapter split are all
explicitly undesigned), not a bug-fix-sized slice.

## Phase 4 (recurrence prevention) — not evaluated here

The original plan's Phase 4 (require `Closes #N` in commit/PR bodies, add a
periodic reconciliation check) is a process change, not a verification
task — out of scope for this closeout, which only confirms Phases 1b-3 are
genuinely done rather than re-deciding whether a process change is still
wanted.
