# The query DSL: what exists, and what might extend it

**Status: mostly a record of what's already built, verified directly — plus a short,
explicitly-marked list of proposed additions that are not implemented.** Grew out of
the Rails integration design doc's reasoning about associations and batch reads; kept
separate because this is a language/persistence-layer concern, not a driving-adapter
one.

## What already exists, verified

`query` and `read_model` are two separate, sibling constructs, both built on the same
shared option vocabulary (`QuerySpecification::Common::DSL`):

```ruby
where(field: value)                  # comparators: eq, ne, gt, gte, lt, lte, in, contains
order_by(field, direction = :asc)
limit(value)
offset(value)
cursor(value)
consistency(mode, timeout: nil)
freshness(mode, max_age: nil)
authorize(policy, tenant: nil)
nulls(mode)
inspect_query(mode = :sql)
use_index(name)
```

`read_model` (`ReadModelBuilder`) additionally has `reference_to`/`include` — a real,
already-built answer to "through relationships, like SQL" at the scale of GATHERING
several aggregates' own rows into one projected shape. This was gotten wrong once in
this project's own reasoning before being checked directly, and is worth stating
precisely now that it's wrong a second way: it used to read "plain `query` never
crosses an aggregate boundary, but `read_model` does" — true when written, no longer
true. A plain `query`'s dotted `where` field can now HOP through a `reference_to`
attribute to filter on the referenced aggregate's own field (`QuerySpecification::HopPath`,
`Runtime::ReferenceHop`) — a different capability than `read_model`'s, answering a
different question. A hop FILTERS one aggregate's own rows by a fact about what they
point at (`Account.OpenForSuspendedCustomers`, in `examples/banking`: `where(status:
"open"); where(:"customer.status" => "suspended")` — still just `Account` rows back,
narrowed by a fact about each one's own `Customer`); `read_model` GATHERS rows from
several aggregates into one new, wider shape. Neither replaces the other:

```ruby
query "OpenForSuspendedCustomers" do
  where(status: "open")
  where(:"customer.status" => "suspended")
  order_by :number
end
```

`read_model`'s own `reference_to`/`include` is not dormant scaffolding either — there's
a live consumer (`adapters/driven/sqlite/projection.rb`) and real corpus usage:

```ruby
read_model "CustomerPortfolio" do
  reference_to Customer
  include Customer
  include Account
  include ATMCard
  include Transfer
end

read_model "ComplianceDashboard" do
  reference_to Account
  include Account
  include CardPayment
end
```

`include`'s cardinality (one record vs. a collection) is inferred automatically —
`many: target != @reference_target` — the root is singular, everything else is a
collection. Note separately: `ReadModel::Specification#joins` is a *different*,
unrelated field on a different class, with zero DSL method that populates it and zero
adapter that reads it — genuinely dormant, unlike `reference_to`/`include`, which are
both live. Don't confuse the two when reading the code.

### `on:` — naming WHICH many-side collection an option applies to (ADR 0055)

`where`/`order_by`/`limit`/`offset` apply to exactly one collection — the single
`include`d aggregate whose head is "many." A read model with zero many-side heads has
nothing for them to filter; with exactly one, that head is unambiguous and needs no
extra word. With **two or more**, an option now names its target explicitly:

```ruby
read_model "NovelSummary" do
  reference_to Novel
  include Novel
  include Character
  include Part
  include Timeline
  include Note

  # `on: Character` — narrows THIS collection alone; Part/Timeline/Note
  # are still gathered in full, untouched.
  where(superseded_by: nil, on: Character)
end
```

`on:` takes the included TYPE (matching `include`'s own argument, resolved the same
way `reference_to`/`include` already resolve theirs) — not the include's own `as:`
alias. Omitting `on:` still works exactly as before when there's exactly one many-side
head; declaring `where`/`order_by`/`limit`/`offset` with no `on:` while several
many-side heads exist is still refused, for the same reason it always was — nothing
says which collection was meant. `on:` is scoped to `read_model` alone: a plain `query`
has only ever had one collection to mean, so `where(..., on: X)` there is a plain,
loud `ArgumentError`, not a silently-ignored option.

**Rust parity: not yet, on purpose.** The Rust kernel's own `ReadModelDef` carries
exactly one eligible head's worth of where/order_by/limit/offset, not a per-head map —
a real, separate porting effort (see ADR 0055). The Ruby-side and Rust-side codegen
generators both refuse to generate a read model that combines several many-side heads
with any declared option at all, cleanly, rather than risk applying an option to the
wrong head.

## One thing left unverified, not fabricated

Whether `include`'s behavior on an absent match reads like an inner join (row dropped)
or a left join (row kept, empty collection) was not traced through
`sqlite/projection.rb` here. Worth confirming directly before relying on it for a case
where a zero-match include must not silently drop the root record — e.g. a compliance
dashboard for accounts with *no* disputed payments should very plausibly still list
the account.

## Proposed additions — not implemented, listed in rough order of how well-motivated each is

- **Aggregation** (`count`/`sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`, with `group_by`). The sharpest gap,
  motivated by the corpus's own existing shape rather than speculation —
  `ComplianceDashboard` reads like exactly the kind of read model that wants "total
  disputed amount" or "count of open disputes," and nothing in the current vocabulary
  computes anything; every option filters, sorts, paginates, or composes raw rows.
- **`having`**, pairing directly with aggregation — filtering on a computed value is a
  different operation from `where` (which filters before any computation), for the
  same reason SQL keeps the two separate.
- **`distinct`** — a plain, common primitive with no equivalent in `comparators.rb` or
  `Options`.
- **Explicit control over `include`'s optionality**, named rather than inferred. This
  is the same problem as the unverified inner-vs-left question above, seen from the
  DSL-authoring side: right now there's no lever to say "this include is required,
  drop the row if absent" versus "this include is optional, keep the row with an
  empty collection" — `many:` only ever answers cardinality, never optionality.
  Adding the lever would resolve the ambiguity rather than leave it to be discovered
  by whatever the adapter happens to do.
- **Compiling a hop into a real SQL `JOIN`.** A hop resolves today by running one
  ordinary query against the hop's target aggregate and folding the ids it answers
  back in as a local `in` clause (`Runtime::ReferenceHop`) — correct on every adapter,
  including a mix of them, but two round trips where a shared Postgres connection
  could in principle answer one JOINed query instead. A real, bounded optimization
  layered on a correct baseline, not a prerequisite for one — worth doing if a hop
  query's two-round-trip cost is ever actually measured to matter, not before.
- **Era/time-aware reads — "as of."** More speculative than the others, and not
  checked against the existing era/lineage system (`EraGuard`, the translation arc) —
  this may already exist there under a different name. Worth naming because it's
  unusually well-motivated for this specific project: `consistency`/`freshness`
  already govern time-related read semantics without touching *which era's shape* to
  read against, and a project this invested in versioned, historically-honest domain
  shapes is exactly where "as of era N" would earn its place if it isn't already
  solved elsewhere.
