# S2 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md) — `.dig` checks `key?`
# at every step, never `||`, which would treat a genuinely-stored
# `false` the same as an absent key and fall through to `nil`. Reading a
# flat key with `values[path.to_s] || values[path.to_sym]` and a nested
# step with `acc[segment.to_sym] || acc[segment]` would drop a
# genuinely-stored `false` to `nil` this way — a sticky re-render of a
# refused boolean-field command, or a prefill from a record actually
# holding `false`, would render as though the field had never been
# filled in at all.
