# THE PRIMARY/DRIVING PORT, END TO END — an adapter outside the bluebook
# calls PortOperationInterpreter (through Dispatcher#dispatch_port), never
# the domain itself. What this proves: the payload gate and coercion run the
# same as a command's, the emitted event carries the operation's own
# attributes verbatim (Emission's own contract, just without a mutated
# instance to source `id:` from), and a policy reacting to that event
# triggers a real command exactly as it would for a command-emitted one.
