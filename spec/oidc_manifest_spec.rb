# The anti-drift gate for every checked-in `oidc.json` — the same shape
# spec/vocabulary_table_spec.rb and spec/parser_table_spec.rb already use
# for their own generated artifacts: regenerate in memory from the
# domain's own bluebook and refuse a diff, so a manifest that stopped
# matching its source fails the ordinary suite rather than waiting for
# someone to notice a stale client scope list in production.
#
# Discovered dynamically, not a hardcoded list — the same domain-glob
# `bin/project_oidc` itself uses, so a new domain that runs the driver and
# commits its own oidc.json is covered here for free, and a domain whose
# manifest gets deleted simply drops out rather than leaving a stale
# expectation behind.
