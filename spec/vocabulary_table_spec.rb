# The anti-drift gate for lib/hecks/vocabulary.rb — the same shape
# spec/parser_table_spec.rb uses for the Rust parser's keyword table:
# regenerate in memory from the language's own declaration and refuse a
# diff, so a checked-in artifact that stopped matching its source fails
# the ordinary suite rather than the next person to read it.
#
# Why the table is checked in at all, rather than built at boot: several
# of these sets are read while a bluebook is being parsed
# (`Attribute::PRIMITIVES` is consulted by the DSL itself). A table built
# from the judged grammar at load time would need the framework to have
# loaded before the framework could load.
