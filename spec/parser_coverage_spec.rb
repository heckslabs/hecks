# THE AUTOMATED ANSWER TO "IS EVERYTHING TAGGED FOR DRIFT FROM RUBY'S OWN
# GRAMMAR". `declared (word, context) pairs from syntax.bluebook` minus
# `hecks-parse coverage`'s own reported set must be empty — minus an
# explicit, reasoned, NAMED allowlist for staged rollout. STAGE 1 left the
# allowlist as basically everything (`hecks-parse coverage` reported `[]`
# — nothing built yet). STAGE 2 shrunk it by exactly the pairs
# pizzas.bluebook actually exercises; STAGE 3 shrinks it further by the
# framework trio's own real usage (this parser now genuinely turns both
# into real IR — mirrors `rust/parser/src/main.rs::COVERED_PAIRS` — kept
# in sync by hand for now, the same "hand-mirrored, not generated" call
# canonical.rs's own header already makes for a table this small and
# stable; if it ever needs to grow past that it should become generated
# the same way keywords.rs itself is). The point is the allowlist is
# VISIBLE and ITEMIZED, and it will shrink stage by stage as parse/*.rs and
# build/*.rs stop being stubs — never silently grow.
# `io: true` — a `cargo build` subprocess spawn is real I/O by this
# suite's own convention (see spec_helper.rb's `io: true` note). The build
# lives in a `before(:context)` hook, not the `describe` body, because
# RSpec still evaluates a group's top-level body while building the
# example tree even when `io: true` excludes every example in it —
# tagging the group alone doesn't stop plain body code from running.

  # THE ALLOWLIST — every (word, context) pair the language declares,
  # MINUS what this parser now genuinely builds (COVERED_PAIRS above).
  # Named per stage rather than left as one undifferentiated blob so a
  # future stage's own shrinkage is visible in the diff: Stage 4 removed
  # banking.bluebook's own slice, Stage 6 (the self-hosted grammar
  # itself — see `spec/parser_parity_spec.rb`'s own "bluebook_language"
  # member) closed a bookkeeping gap (`list_of`/`one_of` `Type`, real
  # since Stage 2/3 but never listed) and confirmed the rest is
  # GENUINELY unreached rather than merely unlisted.
  #
  # STILL NOT EMPTY, honestly, unlike the plan's own optimistic framing
  # ("PENDING_MEMBERS and the coverage allowlist are both empty at the
  # end of this stage") — every remaining pair was individually checked
  # against the WHOLE corpus (`grep`, not a guess) and confirmed to have
  # NO real usage anywhere to build against and byte-match: `has_many`/
  # `has_one` `Aggregate` (declared, sugar identical to the already-built
  # `belongs_to`/`has_one`, but no corpus member ever calls them —
  # `has_many` IS built anyway, see `parse::aggregate`'s own comment, but
  # stays off COVERED_PAIRS per this table's own rule: gated ≠ covered);
  # `reference_to` `Entity`/`Query` (a BARE, un-nested `reference_to`
  # directly inside an `entity`/`query` body — every real usage found is
  # nested inside a `command`, which is the `Command`-context row already
  # covered); `provenance` `Command` (the aggregate-level `provenance
  # from: {...}` keyword nested inside a `command` block — no corpus
  # member does this; `provenance` `Aggregate` IS covered, banking.bluebook's
  # own `Account`); `formerly_known_as` `Bluebook` (a domain rename IS
  # live in production per MEMORY — Embryonaut→EmbryonautFoundersApp —
  # but no `.bluebook` IN THIS CODEBASE'S OWN TRACKED CORPUS declares
  # one); `cursor`/`offset`/`nulls`/`inspect_query` `Query`/`ReadModel`
  # and `authorize` `ReadModel` (declared query/read-model options no
  # tracked corpus member happens to use — `limit`/`where`/`order_by`
  # are, and are covered; `consistency`/`freshness`/`use_index` are gone
  # entirely now, ADR 0025 — declared and parsed by nothing but the HTML
  # form renderer, so they failed the corpus-use-and-doctest bar);
  # `world` `File`, `latest`/`realm` `World`, `subscribe`/
  # `uses_framework` `Hecksagon`, `verb` `DomainPort` (the `World`/
  # `Hecksagon` SIBLING grammar folders — `language/world/`/
  # `language/hecksagon/`, `MetaValidator::WORLD_GRAMMAR`/
  # `HECKSAGON_GRAMMAR` — are real but explicitly OUTSIDE this stage's
  # own scope, which named `MetaValidator::GRAMMAR_FILES`'s nine files
  # specifically; `hecks-parse resolve` for a real `.hecksagon` is also
  # still a Stage 1 stub, unrelated to this stage's own `chapter` work).
  # A future stage that wires up `.world`/`.hecksagon` parsing, or finds
  # a real corpus member exercising one of the others, is exactly what
  # would shrink this the rest of the way — fabricating coverage here
  # instead would be precisely the false claim this whole harness exists
  # to make impossible (this table's own opening comment).
  #
  # `where` `Policy` — new language surface (conditional policy
  # dispatch), same category as the rest of this list: declared for real
  # (PolicyBuilder answers it, PolicyInterpreter evaluates it), but no
  # corpus member `hecks-parse` actually parses (the nine self-hosted
  # grammar files, `pizzas`/`banking`/`compliance`, the framework trio,
  # `spec/fixtures/**`) declares one yet — the real dispatch coverage
  # lives in `spec/runtime/policy_spec.rb`'s own inline-built bluebooks,
  # which `hecks-parse` never sees. It is also the harder half: a `where`
  # is a BLOCK, where every arm `parse::policy` already builds reads a
  # positional text.
  #
  # `for_each` came OFF this list the way the paragraph above says one
  # should: `banking.bluebook`'s own `FreezeAccountsOnSuspension` became
  # the real corpus member exercising it (a suspension has to reach every
  # account the customer holds, and a policy with no fan-out could not
  # address one), and `parse::policy` grew the matching arm.
