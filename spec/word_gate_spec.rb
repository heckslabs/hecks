# THE RUBY-SIDE `word_gate` — item #13 of the whole-project table-
# unification survey, and the first slice of it: Ruby's own DSL
# builders now consult the SAME self-hosted grammar table Rust's own
# parser `word_gate` already reads (`rust/parser/src/parse/mod.rs`),
# instead of falling straight through to Ruby's generic
# `NoMethodError`. Proven behaviorally here rather than just by the
# real corpus continuing to boot byte-identical (which it does — see
# this slice's own commit message) — a synthetic minimal bluebook
# means these tests still catch a regression even if the real corpus
# never happens to exercise a given branch again.
