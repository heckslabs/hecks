# M24 — `bin/fuzz` is a CLI script, not a lib/ file: `shrink_arguments`,
# `outcome`, and friends are plain top-level methods, and the file's own
# tail (ARGV parsing, a real domain sweep, `exit`) runs unconditionally
# the moment the file loads — `require`/`load`ing it directly would run
# a full fuzz sweep and kill the spec process. `bin_fuzz_methods` slices
# out ONLY the method definitions (everything before the CLI's own
# arg-parsing preamble) and evaluates them into a private, throwaway
# module instead, so a method under test can be called directly.

  # `KNOWN_FUZZ_FINDINGS`/`#known_finding?` used to live here — the
  # narrowest possible allowlist (`bin/fuzz`'s own equivalent of
  # `Bluebook::ModelCheck::ALLOWED_FINDINGS`), added in PR #527 to excuse
  # exactly one already-diagnosed finding (hecks_qa BUG#4/BUG#5:
  # `mutations_match_recompute` false-positiving on `NestedPieces::
  # Workspace.Board.AddCard`'s own entity-owned `:append` of a VO-typed
  # field) from failing the sweep while the real fix was still pending.
  # That PR's own commit message pinned the exact self-destructing
  # condition: "this spec fails the moment BUG#4 is actually fixed, which
  # is the signal to delete the entry" — `recompute_append`'s own fix
  # (`lib/hecks/fuzzing/properties/dispatch_and_mutations.rb`) is that
  # fix, seed 2 no longer trips the property at all
  # (`spec/fuzzing/properties_spec.rb`'s own BUG#5 regression pins the
  # exact case), and the mechanism had no other entry and no other
  # purpose — removed whole, mechanism included, rather than left behind
  # empty with nothing real left to test.
