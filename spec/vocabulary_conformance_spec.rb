# The declared vocabularies must equal the tables the runtime actually uses.
#
# Seven closed sets decide what the runtime may accept — the comparison
# operators, the sign tests, the primitive types, the normalisation strategies,
# the mutation ops, the declaration load order, and which errors count as the
# domain refusing rather than the runtime breaking. Each lives in a Ruby
# constant, and each is something the language's own declaration must pin.
#
# Nothing held them together before. The grammar chapter's operator table and
# Expression::Evaluator::COMPARISONS drifted into DISJOINT sets and no gate
# noticed, because a declaration nothing reads cannot disagree with anything.
#
# So this reads the declarations out of the meta-domain's IR and holds the live
# constants to them. Add an operator to the evaluator without declaring it and
# this fails ; declare one the evaluator does not implement and this fails.

  # (`set || append || increment || decrement`) equal to Vocabulary::MutationOp,

  # aggregate roots and a vocabulary's sets are value objects inside one, while
  # inline `one_of` synthesises a fresh set rather than naming an existing one.

  # The language grew the word. `Change.op` says `admits: Vocabulary::MutationOp`
  # and the invariant is deleted, so there is no second copy to hold honest —
  # which is what this gate asked for in so many words. What replaces it is not
  # another comparison but the link itself: an `admits` must name a set the
  # language declares, so dropping the link turns WhereClause.op
  # back into a plain String instead of a closed set.

  # of the two primitives (less_than, equal) it reads and whether the result
