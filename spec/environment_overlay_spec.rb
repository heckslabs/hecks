# RECOVERED, then GENERALIZED — see Runtime::Loader.boot's own comment
# for the full provenance: `environment:` and `uses_embryonaut_bluebook`
# existed on a prior commit of this repo (933d1dd), were vendored out to
# a real consumer (lifeadelics/domain), and were then lost from this
# repo's own reachable history entirely — no branch here reached that
# commit. Ported forward from the consumer's vendor snapshot (the only
# surviving copy), reworked against current main's own Hecksagon/World
# shape rather than copied wholesale, since the two trees had otherwise
# diverged independently for weeks. This spec is the end-to-end proof
# the recovery actually works against a real boot, not just against the
# builder in isolation — dsl_spec.rb covers the builder-level surface.
