# bin/project_deploy's own STACK_OUTPUTS/BASTION_PARAMETERS tables (its
# header explains why they're plain Ruby data, not a bluebook aggregate:
# this is the generator's own internal consistency, never touched by a
# human's input, checked once at generation time — not the kind of
# externally-supplied fact given/invariant exists for). This spec
# doesn't test those tables directly — bin/project_deploy is a script,
# not a library, and there's nothing to require — it tests the thing
# that actually matters: that the THREE GENERATED FILES still agree
# with each other, parsed back out of real output, not re-derived from
# the same table that could just as easily be wrong in the same way in
# all three places at once.

  # subprocess (a fresh Ruby process booting the whole framework) once
  # per example was pure duplication, not three different checks.
