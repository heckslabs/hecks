# `GenericDispatch.try`'s own `case shape[:kind]` has an `else` backstop —
# `shape_for` names exactly four kinds today (:calls_through/:opens_block/
# :zero_arg/:single_fill), but a fifth added there without a matching `when`
# here would otherwise fall through to bare `nil`, which `WordGate#method_missing`'s
# own caller reads as "handled" (anything but NOT_HANDLED counts) — so a
# self-hosted DSL word would silently execute as a no-op rather than raise
# the "not yet implemented" refusal a genuinely unmigrated word already
# gets. `shape_for` cannot itself produce a fifth kind today, so this stubs
# it directly to exercise the backstop past the one gate that would
# otherwise prevent reaching it.
