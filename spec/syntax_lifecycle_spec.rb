# Every word of the bluebook surface now stands somewhere in its own
# life — the same proposed → admitted → retired shape the expression
# grammar's operators carry, plus `deprecated` (still read, on its way
# out). A row defaults to admitted, so the syntax table stays a table of
# words; only a word entering or leaving the language spells its status.
#
# (Constants here carry unique names on purpose: a constant assigned
# inside an RSpec.describe block lands at top level — the block captures
# its file's lexical scope — so a keywords here silently replaced
# syntax_conformance_spec's stringified keywords for every file loaded
# after it. Found as an order-dependent NoMethodError two files away.)
#
# What makes the status load-bearing rather than decorative is the
# projection rule this file pins: a proposed or retired word reaches no
# generated parser table, so to every projected reader such a word simply
# does not exist — the operator rule, applied at the syntax layer. The
# language also declares its own version now, on the chapter itself,
# bumped when the admitted surface changes.
