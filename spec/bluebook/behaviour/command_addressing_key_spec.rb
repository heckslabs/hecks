# `Behaviour::Command#addressing_key_for` — the fix for a real bug found
# wiring `for_each` into banking (this session's own property-testing
# arc): a fan-out dispatch minting `<aggregate>_id` for every target
# command unconditionally refuses every dispatch to a command declared
# on the very aggregate it self-references
# (`Account.FreezeAccount`, addressed by `account`/its own identity, never a
# synthetic foreign key).
#
# **Pinned against real banking commands directly** — no fixture, no
# dispatch, no policy, no `for_each` wiring anywhere in this file. The
# regression this method fixes is real and general (it's asked of any
# resolved target command, by name, whether or not any policy in the
# current corpus actually exercises it via `for_each` today — see
# banking.bluebook's own comment on `FreezeAccountsOnSuspension` for
# why `for_each` itself isn't wired into a real banking policy right
# now, independent of this fix's own correctness).
