# `creates_owner?` (rust/project/mutations.rb) replaced `command[:references]
# .nil?` as the "does this command build the owner record from scratch" test
# `rust/project/commands.rb#emit_command` and `identity_components` both
# consult, closing the Rust compile break RESTART.md describes: 12 meta-
# domain "attach one child to the owner" commands (`Aggregate.Attribute` et
# al.) each declare an argument coincidentally named the same as one of
# their owner's `identified_by` components (both have a field called
# `name`) while never setting the owner's own field — their one mutation
# appends that argument into a list, sourced by it, which would otherwise fool
# `identity_components`'s bare-name check into treating it as the owner's
# own id and misassigning it into the wrong-typed identity slot.
#
# Unexercised by the ordinary suite on purpose — Ruby's own runtime stopped
# consulting `Command#creates?` for hydration this session
# (`CommandInterpreter#step_hydrate` uses `Runtime::DependencyPlanning::
# Analyzer` instead), so nothing in spec/*.rb exercises this exact path;
# only a Rust `cargo build` (or this spec) would have caught a wrong edit
# here. Fixtures below are plain projector-shaped hashes, the same input
# shape `bin/project_rust` itself feeds these methods — not full domain
# parses, matching `constraints_spec.rb`/`bridging_spec.rb`'s own reasoning
# for testing a pure codegen helper directly.
