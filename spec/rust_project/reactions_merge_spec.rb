# `emit_merged_policy_table`/`emit_merged_cross_domain_policy_table` —
# the recovery of a documented, deliberate gap: bin/project_rust used to
# build its ONE merged Store's policy/cross-domain-policy tables from
# ONLY the target domain's own policies, silently dropping every
# attached/vendored chapter's own. Invisible until a domain vendored a
# chapter that actually declares policies (Governance/Identity, the only
# framework chapters exercised before this, declare none) — found live
# generating lifeadelics' vendored embryonaut_bluebooks/payments:
# `OnPaymentConfirmedByProcessor`'s own trigger never fired against the
# merged Store, even though payments/registry.rs's own STANDALONE table
# had it all along. Tested directly here, same reasoning
# bridging_spec.rb's own header gives for an identically-shaped latent
# gap with no corpus domain exercising it.
