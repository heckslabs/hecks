# A refusal is the domain saying no. Anything else is the runtime breaking.
#
# `Runtime::DOMAIN_REFUSALS` declares that boundary, and the policy and saga
# interpreters honour it — they rescue only those classes, so a crash in a
# reaction propagates instead of being logged as "declined". The runner did
# not: `bin/run` catches everything a dispatch throws and
# writes it into `refusals`, so a crash arrives in the run contract wearing a
# refusal's clothes.
#
# That is not hypothetical. Every one of these was recorded as a refusal:
#
#   positive? expects a number, got {"value":3}     the append flatten bug
#   no implicit conversion of Symbol into Integer   an argument/attribute collision
#   addition expects a number, got "a lot"          a String reaching a numeric field
#
# The last is fixed at the source — `Value.check_numeric_fields` now refuses it
# as a TypeMismatch, which is a domain refusal. This spec is what stops the
# class from coming back: every error the corpus provokes must be one the
# domain is allowed to raise.
