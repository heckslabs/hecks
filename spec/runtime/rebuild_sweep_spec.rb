# The out-of-band half of `projects` (S12, ADR 0025 — "Consistency
# across aggregate boundaries") — proven end to end against a
# dedicated fixture, not the real corpus: banking's own Account
# declares `projects :customer_status`, which its own `given
# ("customer is active")` now reads for real (S12's own migration,
# `CommandInterpreter#seed_projected_fields` and this file's own
# updated expectations).
#
# `seed_projected_fields` (`command_interpreter.rb`) means a
# projected field is no longer absent-until-manually-swept the way
# it was before this migration — every command that saves a record
# with `projects` fields resolves them once, synchronously, the same
# read `RebuildSweep` itself would do. `RebuildSweep` stays the
# mechanism for the case seeding cannot cover: the target moving
# after this record's own last write, with nothing here to notice.
