# The boot-time gate for adapters that HAVE eras. Eras are facts about
# stored data some adapter can carry across a shape change, so only a
# lineage-capable adapter holds them — everything else has no era, holds
# nothing, and is never lectured about drift it could not act on. (The
# Postgres side of this lives in spec/adapters/postgres_lineage_spec.rb.)
#
# What remains adapter-agnostic is the compute gate, which was never an
# era fact. Its refusal is pinned byte-for-byte — the wording is contract,
# asserted here against the fixture.
