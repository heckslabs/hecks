  # ported onto banking.bluebook (feat/banking-status-guards) — not
  # exhaustive (~113 individual `given`s across ~56 commands), but one
  # real example per category: a bare CUSTOMER-status guard, a bare
  # ACCOUNT-status guard, an aliased cross-aggregate reference
  # (source/destination) status guard, and an "other" own-record
  # status/state guard that has nothing to do with customer/account at
  # all. Section 223's "dereferencing a related record's field" tests,
  # above, already prove several more of these guards fire as a side
  # effect of proving the DEREFERENCING mechanism itself — this section
  # is about the GUARDS, not the mechanism.
