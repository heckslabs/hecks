# A POLICY'S `with:` MAY READ THE EMITTING RECORD'S OWN IDENTITY.
#
# Routing separated from payload (`to:`/`with:`) stopped carrying the
# emitting aggregate's identity in an event's payload — right for the
# event, but it left a CROSS-aggregate reaction with no way to say which
# record to address. The real case: chess's Graveyard is one per game,
# fed by policy from every piece's own Captured event; an entity
# command's event never declares its aggregate's identity (it arrives
# through `reference_to`), so `with: { label: :label }` was refused at
# build time and a wholesale forward fell through to the captured
# piece's `id` as the graveyard's identity — every burial refused.
#
# `PolicyInterpreter#emitter_identity` offers `Event#id` under the
# emitter's own identity heads, to an explicit projection only;
# `BluebookBuilder.check_with_spec!` admits the same names.
RSpec.describe "a policy projecting its emitter's identity" do
  # ONE INLINE BLUEBOOK, DECLARED WHOLE — a domain-definition DSL block
  # read top to bottom as the fixture, not a sequence of independent
  # steps; splitting it would scatter one readable declaration across
  # several methods that only make sense read back-to-back.
