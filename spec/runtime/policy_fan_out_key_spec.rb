# THE NAME A FAN-OUT'S ROW ID ARRIVES UNDER.
#
# `spec/runtime/policy_spec.rb` already covers `for_each` end to end and
# asserts delivery — and passed for a reason that was not the rule. Its
# `Fanout::Account` is `identified_by :account_id` over an
# `attribute :account_id`, so the row id merged as `account_id:` matched
# the aggregate's own IDENTITY HEAD directly and never needed the
# reference key at all. Every aggregate in the real corpus names its
# identity something else (`Account` is `identified_by AccountNumber,
# as: :number`), so the same policy shape refused there with
# `UnknownArgument` naming a key the command could not take, and the
# refusal was recorded per row in the reaction log rather than raised
# anywhere a caller would look.
#
# So this fixture deliberately does NOT name its identity after itself.
# It is the difference between the two spellings, isolated:
#
#   trigger acts on the fanned aggregate -> bare `chit:`
#   trigger stores it as a reference     -> `chit_id:`
RSpec.describe "a for_each policy's row id" do
  # One DSL-declared fixture domain (three aggregates plus the one policy
  # under test), not branchy logic — its length and ABC score come from
  # declaring the domain shape both examples below share, per the class
  # comment above explaining why `Chit`'s identity is deliberately NOT
  # named `chit`. Splitting the bluebook block across helper methods would
  # fragment one coherent domain declaration for no readability gain.
