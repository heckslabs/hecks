# persistence capability (the adapter-side `save_saga`/`delete_saga`/
# `each_saga` implementations land per adapter in §3/§4 and get their
# own dedicated round-trip specs there; this proves the RESOLUTION
# logic itself: which adapter instance (or the no-op fallback) a
# domain's saga state would persist through, entirely independent of
# whether any real adapter answers the capability yet).

  # decided explicitly) but its own anchor aggregate declares no bind
  # at all, which `Ports::Persistence::BindingPolicy.resolve` refuses
  # loudly (`missing_binding`) rather than silently defaulting. Saga
  # persistence degrades to the same no-op default an unbound domain
  # gets instead of raising out of what would otherwise be a
  # successful dispatch — deliberately NOT calling `verify!` here,
  # since `verify!` would itself raise on this exact gap (by design,
  # for a domain's own real persistence) and this test is about what
  # `saga_persistence` alone does when asked anyway.
