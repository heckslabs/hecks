# §8 — `verify!` warns, loudly and at boot, when a domain declares a
# `process_manager` but its resolved `saga_persistence` has no
# `save_saga` (NULL_SAGA_STORE). Sagas still run correctly in-process
# on that store; what's missing is durability across a restart — no
# checkpoint, no rehydration, no compensation replay if the process
# dies mid-saga. Silent until then, which is exactly the shape ADR
# 0025 refused for an unchecked `role`. Here the same gap gets a
# WARNING rather than a refusal, because — unlike an ungoverned role —
# running a saga on a non-durable store is something an author chooses
# on purpose in dev/test (`saga_durability_spec.rb`'s own saga_mutex
# spec boots the identical Wire fixture on Memory for exactly that
# reason), so refusing the boot outright would make that legitimate
# choice impossible.
