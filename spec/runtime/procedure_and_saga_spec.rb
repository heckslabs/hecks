# A PROCEDURE coordinates. It is a SAGA when it also knows how to undo itself.
#
# These are two things and the industry slurs them into one word. A procedure has
# legs, states, and an opinion about who goes next. A saga has compensation: every
# step that changed the world declares what makes it good again, and a failure
# runs those backwards. Neither implies the other — a hiring pipeline is ordered
# and has no undo, a choreographed refund has undo and nobody in charge.
#
# The word `saga` appears in no .bluebook and never will: it is not a word a bank
# says, and an author never types it. They declare a compensating leg, and the
# saga-ness FOLLOWS. So the name is derived rather than declared, which is also
# why it cannot drift from the thing it describes.
