# CommandBuilder#delegates_to_impl's own comment has the full reasoning —
# this proves the runtime side: CommandInterpreter#step_delegate_to_entity
# actually gives synchronous refusal propagation and atomic all-or-nothing
# persistence, the two properties neither `trigger` nor a saga's own
# `dispatches` can give (both commit the triggering command first and
# rescue the target's own refusal). See spec/word_coverage_spec.rb's own
# EXEMPT entry for `delegates_to` — this file is that word's real,
# running, dispatch-level coverage.

  # A REAL BUG, found live building this fixture's own downstream
  # consumer (a chess domain): `with:` only remaps what it names, and a
  # first draft of `step_delegate_to_entity` built `target_args` from
  # `with:` ALONE — so a policy reacting to the delegated command's own
  # emitted event, trying to re-locate Board by its own identity
  # (`name`, never named in `with: { id:, to: }`), found nothing and its
  # reaction was rescued and recorded rather than raised (the same
  # commit-then-react shape every OTHER policy reaction has). Fixed by
  # starting `target_args` from a copy of the delegating command's own
  # already-resolved args, so ambient context a caller never had to
  # name explicitly still flows through, same as a direct entity
  # dispatch always would.
