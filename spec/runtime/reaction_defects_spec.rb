# A reaction has two ways to not happen, and they are not the same thing.
#
# The domain REFUSING (a given not met, a lifecycle move not admitted, a
# cross-domain target not loaded in this deployment) is a fact worth recording :
# the command that emitted the event still stands, and the log says why.
#
# The runtime BREAKING (a NoMethodError in an interpreter, a NameError from a
# missing constant) is a defect. It once had two wrong homes in a row : first
# a blanket `rescue StandardError` that wrote it as `delivered: false` beside
# every legitimate refusal, so a crashed runtime read as normal operation ;
# then, after that was narrowed to DOMAIN_REFUSALS alone, nothing caught it at
# all, so it propagated straight through the ALREADY-SUCCEEDED triggering
# command's own `dispatch` call and blew that up too. Neither is right : a
# defect is now caught (so the triggering command's success stands), but
# recorded distinguishably (`defect: true`, the error's own class) rather than
# folded into an ordinary refusal's shape, and warned to STDERR so it is never
# silent.
