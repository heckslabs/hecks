# Dispatcher#dry_run?'s own comment has the full reasoning — built for a
# downstream chess domain's own whole-board postcondition tests ("does
# this move leave my own king in check"), which previously had to
# dispatch a real, unrelated piece's own move purely to trigger the
# check, and that move then had to avoid interfering with the very
# position being tested. Reuses the delegates_to fixture — it already
# has a plain entity command (Piece.Move) AND a delegating aggregate
# command (Board.MovePiece) AND a policy reacting to the entity's own
# event, which is exactly the surface dry_run needs to prove itself
# against: does a dry run see through the delegation, and does it
# correctly reach NEITHER persistence NOR reactions in either shape.

  # No port-bearing fixture was worth building fresh for this alone —

  # fixture. Named here so the gap is visible, not silently assumed
  # covered.
