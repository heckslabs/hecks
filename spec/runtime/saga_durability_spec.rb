# §5/§6/§7 END TO END — the actual regression this whole phase exists
# to fix: a process manager sitting in a mid-flight (or, here, a
# terminal-but-never-cleaned-up) state survives a process restart,
# through a REAL adapter, not the Memory one `spec/runtime/saga_spec.rb`
# stays on. Uses the Wire fixture's own `Carry` saga
# (spec/fixtures/settlement.bluebook) bound to SqlitePersistence rather
# than a purpose-built fixture, the same "reuse the existing Carry
# process manager, re-bound to each adapter under test" the plan calls
# for.
#
# `Carry`'s own `on "WireAsked"`/`on "Taken"`/`on "PutIn"` legs all
# cascade SYNCHRONOUSLY within one `dispatch` call (`deliver_saga_
# dispatch` re-enters through the same door), so there is no publicly
# observable "waiting for a later, separate dispatch" window for the
# happy path. The `on :refused` leg is different: shutting the
# DESTINATION drawer before asking a wire makes `Wire::Drawer.Put`
# refuse, `unwind` moves the saga to `"returned"`, and `"returned"` has
# no further transition in this bluebook — a REAL, naturally-arising
# stuck state, structurally the same shape as Banking's own `Settlement`
# sitting in `"awaiting_credit"` this whole arc is about.
