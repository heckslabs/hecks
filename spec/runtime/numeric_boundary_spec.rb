# had no NaN, no Infinity, no -0.0, and `INTEGER_EDGE_CASES` had no
# Bignum: "classic silent-corruption territory," per the PRD's own words,
# never exercised by a single spec repo-wide before this. Traced each
# through `Value::Coercion#check_numeric_fields` and
# `CommandRules::Arithmetic`, real corpus value object (`Banking::
# ATMCard::DailyFee`, `attribute :amount, Float`), same convention
# `identifier_numeric_coercion_growth_spec.rb` already established for
# direct coercion-boundary testing.
