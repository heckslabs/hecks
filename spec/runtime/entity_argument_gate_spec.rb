# H1 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md) — an entity command used to
# run NEITHER `refuse_unknown_arguments` NOR `refuse_absent_arguments` at
# all, on a comment claiming it "inherits its aggregate's own gate."
# Nothing on the entity dispatch path ever ran one: a bogus argument was
# accepted outright, and a command that both declares an argument AND
# `sets` a field from it (`Advance`'s own `note`, below) silently wrote
# `nil` over the stored value when that argument was simply omitted —
# persisted data loss, no refusal. `EntityInterpreter` now `include`s the
# same `CommandInterpreter::ArgumentGate` an aggregate command's own dispatch
# already runs (entity_interpreter.rb's own H1 comment), extended with the
# entity chain's own identity heads as addressing (`step_refuse_unknown_
# arguments`'s own comment) so a legitimate dispatch — which must supply the
# entity's own identity (`sequence:`, here) alongside the root's (`label:`)
# — is never mistaken for an unknown argument.
