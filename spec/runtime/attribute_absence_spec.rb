# ADR 0025, "Added attributes and absence": the read-side half of S11.
# GuardState's own nil-read (hydrate_defaults_spec.rb's boot-time half —
# `Instance.hydrate_with_defaults` — is the write-side companion) would
# answer nil for any declared-but-absent field, optional or not. That is
# exactly right for optional — nil is what optional means — and exactly
# wrong for a required field with no default: a `given`/`ensures` reading
# it would silently evaluate against a value nobody ever wrote, the same
# bug class as an unpopulated projection reading "not active". This pins
# the narrowed behaviour: optional stays nil, required raises named.
