# command_interpreter/argument_gate.rb names this "the weakest part of the
# gate": a saga's correlation key legitimately arrives on commands that
# never declare it, because `correlation_keys` widens the allow-list
# domain-wide. `deliver_saga_dispatch` now stamps the key it already knows
# onto the event(s) its own dispatch causes, so a leg that stops smuggling
# the key through its with-spec still correlates — closing the gap
# additively, without removing the smuggle path any existing saga relies on.
RSpec.describe "a saga leg that never declares the correlation key at all" do
  # One declarative `Hecks.bluebook` fixture (two aggregates, a saga leg
  # between them) — the length is the DSL's own shape. Splitting it would
  # only break the single `bluebook`/`with_registry` block scope this
  # fixture needs to be one coherent domain.
