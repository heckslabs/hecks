# H7 — QueryInterpreter's ENTITY engine (`entity_rows`, the only engine
# entity/sub-list queries have) still had two of the three bugs the audit
# named, after `#interpret`/`#reference_interpret` had already picked up
# their own offset fix (see query_interpreter_offset_spec.rb):
#
#   1. `entity_rows` applied `limit` but never read `declared.offset` at
#      all — a declared offset on an entity query silently vanished,
#      always answering page one however many pages were asked for.
#   2. `element_where_holds?` read `element[clause.field.to_sym]` instead
#      of walking `FieldPath.dig` — a dotted `where` (`where "price.cents"
#      > 0`) is never a real single key, so it read `nil` for every
#      element and (correctly, per NullPolicy) excluded every row —
#      an entity query with a dotted where silently answered `[]`.
#
# A THIRD, sibling bug lived one level up: the plain aggregate-level
# `ordered` (used by `#interpret`/`#reference_interpret`, the reference/
# no-native-hook engine) read `record[field]` directly too — a dotted
# `order_by` on an ORDINARY (non-entity) query sorted by all-nil, so two
# records with different dotted-field values landed in whatever order the
# identity tier alone decided (here: dispatch/creation order), not the
# declared order.
RSpec.describe "QueryInterpreter — entity offset and dotted where/order_by" do
  # A declarative inline bluebook fixture reproducing the three bugs
  # described above — splitting it would only fragment one self-
  # contained domain declaration across artificial boundaries.
