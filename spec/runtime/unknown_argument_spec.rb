# A command takes the arguments it declares, and no others.
#
# `normalize_args` walked the command's declared attributes over a copy of the
# payload, so anything the command did not declare simply rode along untouched
# and was never looked at again. A misspelled argument was accepted in silence
# and did nothing.
#
# Found by renaming a field in the language: spec/meta_rules_spec kept dispatching
# the old `identity:` long after the attribute became `identified_by`, and the
# suite stayed green. A rename that leaves every caller wrong is supposed to be
# the easiest kind of mistake to catch.
