  # This reaches the door through DailyLimit, not EmailAddress or

  # (`address.include?("@")`), is a declared `pattern:` now, and a pattern
  # mismatch would fire before the invariant is ever reached — testing
  # through it would quietly stop testing invariants at all while keeping
  # the test's name.
  #
  # CustomerNumber went through the identical shift: it also has a
  # `pattern:` of its own now (the whitespace-only sweep — banking's own
  # value objects, alongside shape.bluebook's), so a blank reference is
  # refused as a TypeMismatch before CustomerNumber's own invariant is
  # ever reached. DailyLimit is an Integer field with no pattern to shadow
  # it (patterns only ever apply to String), so its own invariant is
  # genuinely still what fires here.

  # (examples/banking/bluebook/statements.bluebook), a real member of this
  # very corpus, not a synthetic fixture — was admitted the instant its
  # `cadence` matched a declared row, no matter what `retention_months`/
  # `paper_fee_cents` said. Confirmed live with the fix reverted: `Value.build`
  # with `cadence: "monthly"` (a real member) alongside an invalid
  # `retention_months`/`paper_fee_cents` raised nothing.
