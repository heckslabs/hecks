# M13 — an entity's attribute types are never resolved as references.
#
# Aggregate.Attribute types its `type` argument `reference_to ValueObject` —
# "attributes must use value-object types" is enforced by reference
# resolution, not a predicate (that command's own comment). Entity.Attribute
# carried the identical field as plain text, so an entity attribute naming an
# undeclared value object — a typo, or a type that was never declared at all —
# built clean. `entity.bluebook`'s own "Attribute" command now carries the
# same `reference_to ValueObject, as: :type` Aggregate's does, and an entity
# attribute whose type names a nested piece routes through a new "Holds"
# command (mirroring Aggregate.Holds) rather than falling through to the same
# ValueObject-reference check a plain attribute uses.
