# A LIST THE CORPUS ONLY EVER FILLS WITH ONE IS A SCALAR AS FAR AS ANYTHING CAN TELL.
#
# The corpus specs prove the runtime answers as the frozen IR says it should,
# and perturbing a DECLARATION shows what changes. Neither can reach a form no
# corpus bluebook uses at all — there is nothing to run and nothing to perturb —
# and that is precisely where the composite identity hid.
#
# `identified_by` has been `list_of(IdentityPath)` since identity became a path.
# Every example declared exactly one, so `paths.first()` and "every path, joined"
# were the same function on the whole corpus. A reader once took the first. It
# also could not PARSE a second one: `identified_by do` opened a block the
# aggregate parser never consumed, so every attribute, command and value object
# after it was swallowed and the aggregate came back empty — silently, because
# an empty aggregate does not look like a parse failure. Green everywhere, for
# as long as the corpus said one.
#
# So this asks the language what it declares as a LIST, and asks the corpus
# whether any member ever holds two. A field that never does is not a bug on its
# own — it is a claim nobody has tested, and it must be NAMED here with a reason,
# the way `contracts.rb`'s `derived:` column names what the IR does not carry. A
# claim needs a kind.
#
# ADDING A LIST TO THE LANGUAGE AND NO CORPUS MEMBER THAT FILLS IT TWICE IS WHAT
# THIS CATCHES. That is the shape of the bug, stated once, instead of waiting for
# the next one.

      The language declares these as lists and no golden carries a key by that
      name, so their plurality cannot be measured at all:

        #{unmeasured.join("\n        ")}

      Either the IR does not carry the field — say so in `contracts.rb`'s
      `derived:` column, which is where that fact belongs — or the wire spells it
      differently, which is a defect: add it to WIRE_SPELLING and read the note
      there about why the entry should not exist.

      These lists are declared by the language and never filled with more than one
      anywhere in the corpus, and nothing says why:

        #{unnamed.join("\n        ")}

      A list the corpus only ever fills with one is indistinguishable from a scalar,
      so a runtime that reads the first element passes every check there is. That is
      how `identified_by` hid a parser that could not read a second path at all.

      Either add a corpus member that fills it twice — spec/corpus/domains/ exists
      for exactly this, and `market` was added for exactly this — or add an entry to
      ALLOWED_SINGLETON saying what is untested and why.
