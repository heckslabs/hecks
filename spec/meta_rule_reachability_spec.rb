# Every declared given/invariant/ensures RULE must be SEEN REFUSING — not
# just the verb it hangs off.
#
# spec/judge_coverage_spec.rb proves every declared VERB is offered to the
# judge. That is necessary but not sufficient: offering a verb only opens
# the door a rule sits behind, and its own header names three prior escapes
# where a declaration nobody exercised sat underneath a green guard —
# unreachable rules, unjudged categories, a coverage guard that checked
# `*.Declare` and missed `Command.Argument`/`ValueObject.Field` entirely.
# Each time, the fix moved the grain finer. This is one grain finer again:
# a verb can be dispatched into constantly while the SPECIFIC rule attached
# to it never once sees the input that would make it refuse.
#
# spec/meta_rules_spec.rb is this codebase's own answer to that, and its own
# header states the standard plainly: "Every rule here must be SEEN
# REFUSING." What that file does not do is prove its own coverage is
# COMPLETE — it proves the rules someone remembered to write a refusing
# example for. This gate reads every given/invariant/ensures the meta-domain
# actually declares straight off the grammar (`Hecks::QueryIR.collect_rules`
# — the same enumeration `spec/fuzzing/meta_domain_coverage_spec.rb` already
# uses one level over, for attribute rather than rule coverage) and requires
# each one to be either PROVEN firing somewhere in the suite, cited by
# file:line, or named as an honest KNOWN_GAP — the same
# claim-or-name-the-gap discipline that file already established.
#
# THIS IS NOT A CLEAN GATE TODAY. As of this writing: 62 declared rules, 14
# proven, 48 open gaps. That number is not a target to defend down to zero
# in one sitting — it is the actual current size of the claim "a bluebook
# that violates an invariant refuses to boot," made visible and trackable
# instead of assumed. Closing a gap means either writing the refusing
# example (preferred — add it to spec/meta_rules_spec.rb and move the entry
# from META_RULE_KNOWN_GAPS to META_RULE_PROVEN below) or discovering the
# declaration is unreachable/dead (a fifth instance of this project's own
# characteristic defect, and worth its own fix).
