  # ADR 0025, "References" — the whole point of widening this check from a
  # direct pair to a real DFS: every existing spec (this file's own case
  # above, spec/dsl_spec.rb's Rider/Bicycle and Board/Product cases) is a
  # 2-node ring, which the OLD direct-pair-only check already caught.
  # Nothing proved the actual widening — a ring with a THIRD aggregate in
  # the middle — until this case.
  # The whole point is the THIRD aggregate in the ring — a two-node fixture
  # already exists elsewhere in the suite; splitting this one further would
  # just shrink it back to the case that already existed before this ADR.
