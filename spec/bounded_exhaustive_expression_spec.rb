# Phase 7 (equivalence-gap plan) — see `Hecks::Fuzzing::
# BoundedExhaustiveExpressions`'s own header for the full design (why
# type-directed, what "proven" means here precisely, what it does and
# does not claim). Deterministic and fast (a few thousand cases, well
# under a second) — this runs in the default suite, no `io:`/`fuzzing:`
# tag needed.
#
# Found four real, previously-undiscovered parsing bugs live, all fixed
# alongside this file (see each one's own comment at its fix site):
#   - `Resolver#match_call` (nested AND chained `.modulo(...)`)
#   - `Evaluator#match_include` (nested `.include?(...)`)
#   - `Evaluator#top_level_index` / `Resolver#split_addition` (`[`/`]`
#     never counted toward bracket depth, so an array literal containing
#     its own top-level `+`/comparison mis-split the ENCLOSING expression)
# None had any real corpus precedent (grep, all four) — sampling-based
# fuzzing essentially never manufactures the specific nested/chained/
# bracketed shapes that triggered them, which is exactly why exhaustive,
# type-directed generation exists as its own, separate technique here
# rather than a wider `bin/fuzz` seed count.
