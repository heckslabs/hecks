# THE LANGUAGE IS THE SOURCE, and this is what holds it to that.
#
# `MetaValidator.call` returns `Assembly.call(held[:declaration])` — the graph the
# meta-domain HOLDS — and `Hecks.bluebook` registers whatever comes back, so the
# runtime runs the language's graph and not the builder's. The builder's own graph
# exists only to be dispatched in ; nothing keeps it.
#
# This spec compares the two graphs FIELD BY FIELD, TYPE INCLUDED, and there is
# nothing left in the gap list. Type included is the whole point: `to_h`
# stringifies, so byte equality cannot see a Symbol that came back a String, and
# five real breaks hid exactly there —
#
#   an entity's `identified_by`     "pass sequence:", while sequence was passed
#   a procedure's `correlates_by`   the settlement wire never advanced
#   a saga leg's object literal     the debit leg was never delivered
#   a closed set's member values    a set admitting "0" refusing the 0 passed
#   an aggregate's reference targets Pizza pointing at itself, twice
#
# Each looked identical on the wire and stopped the runtime dead. Only running
# the corpus end to end (spec/corpus/ scripts do this now)
# caught the third, because a saga that silently does nothing looks exactly like a
# saga with nothing to do.

  # It held thirteen entries, all of them justified by the same wrong belief: that
  # the language may only hold what `to_h` carries. `ReadModel#to_h` omits a read
  # model's filters, and a hoisted
  # policy lost which head declared it — so all of that looked unrecoverable.
  #
  # It was not. `to_h` is a PROJECTION for consumers ; the language is the
  # SOURCE. They must agree about everything to_h spells and need not be the same
  # size. Both are held now — the filters as option rows, the policy's head as a
  # field — and the wire format did not move, so no consumer noticed.
  #
  # Anything added here from now on is a claim that the language cannot hold
  # something, and that claim should be very hard to make.
