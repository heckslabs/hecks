# THE FOLLOW-UP TO `spec/project_rust_pipeline_spec.rb`, continuing from
# where Stage 8 (`/Users/christopheryoung/.claude/plans/sequential-petting-whale.md`)
# left off: that spec proves the OPT-IN Ruby-orchestrated all-Rust
# pipeline (`HECKS_PARSER=rust HECKS_CODEGEN=rust bin/project_rust
# <domain>`, still itself a Ruby process shelling out to `hecks-parse`/
# `hecks-codegen`) matches the DEFAULT Ruby path. THIS spec proves the
# NEW all-the-way-down Rust binary — `rust/build/` (`hecks-build`),
# which does the SAME job with NO Ruby process involved anywhere in its
# own execution, not even for orchestration — produces the IDENTICAL
# generated tree the opt-in Ruby pipeline does, for real, byte-exact,
# not asserted once by hand.
#
# `hecks-build` is called here with `--no-build` (generate source only,
# skip the `cargo build --release` step for the domain's own compiled
# artifact) — matching `spec/project_rust_pipeline_spec.rb`'s own
# pattern of comparing GENERATED SOURCE, not compiled output, and
# keeping this spec fast enough for the normal `bundle exec rspec` loop.
# The real, actual `cargo build --release` (and, separately,
# `cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1`) path IS exercised —
# just not from inside this spec: see this stage's own report for the
# real commands run and their real output, plus `cargo test --release`
# inside `rust/` (the `from_json_round_trip.rs` integration tests)
# passing against `hecks-build`'s own generated banking tree.
#
# NO `lineage`-only EXCEPTION NEEDED HERE: both `hecks-build`
# (`lineage_pass.rs`) and the opt-in Ruby pipeline it's compared against
# here (`rust/project_rust_pipeline.rb::derive_lineage`) compute the
# `lineage` key for real now, from the same narrow `.hecksagon`
# `persisted_by`-bind text scan, ported line for line — so
# `ir.json`/`metadata.rs` are expected to be PLAIN BYTE-IDENTICAL too,
# same as every other generated file. `manifest.json` stays the one
# remaining named, deliberate gap (coverage bookkeeping only) — neither
# side writes it, so the file-list comparison below never sees it on
# either side and needs no exclusion list.
