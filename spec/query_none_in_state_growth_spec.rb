# Real dispatch coverage for `none_in_state` -- finding #13, a
# cross-aggregate anti-join comparator: `where field: { none_in_state:
# "Aggregate:state" }` holds when the record `field`'s value points at
# is NOT currently in that state (including when it points at no record
# at all). Exercised on an ENTITY query -- the equivalent AGGREGATE-level
# query has a separate, later-landing gap in `Ports::Query::InMemory`
# this coverage does not exercise.
#
# `meta_validation: false` -- the self-hosted grammar's own
# Vocabulary::QueryComparator doesn't admit `none_in_state` yet (a
# separate, later-landing item in this split registers the new
# comparator word); turned off here so what's under test is this PR's
# own comparator/interpreter pair, not that separate gap.
