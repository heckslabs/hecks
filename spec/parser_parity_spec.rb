# THE DIFFERENTIAL HARNESS — the anti-drift mechanism for the Rust parser,
# modeled directly on spec/rust_conformance_spec.rb's own cargo-build-then-
# subprocess-inside-rspec pattern, and on spec/corpus_spec.rb's own
# Dir.glob-derived (never hand-listed) corpus enumeration, so a new
# example/grammar-chapter/framework member is covered here automatically.
#
# STAGE 1 left every real corpus member PENDING — the parser built no IR
# at all yet. STAGE 2 shrunk PENDING_MEMBERS by exactly one
# (`pizzas.bluebook` + its `.hecksagon`, ~60% of the language surface in
# one small file — the plan's own deliberately-first target) and added a
# REAL byte-exact assertion for it in REAL_PARITY_MEMBERS below: shell out
# to `hecks-parse chapter --chapter Pizzas <bluebook> <hecksagon>` and
# compare the stdout JSON, byte for byte, against Ruby's own
# `JSON.pretty_generate(Exporter.call(...))` for the SAME two files loaded
# the same order `bin/project_rust` itself loads them (`.bluebook` first,
# registering every aggregate; `.hecksagon` second, mutating those
# already-registered aggregates' own `ports`). STAGE 3 does the identical
# thing for the framework trio — `identity.bluebook`/`governance.bluebook`/
# `console_settings.bluebook`, each standing alone (no `.hecksagon` of its
# own — see REAL_PARITY_MEMBERS' own comment on why). Every other corpus
# member stays pending, untouched, for a later stage. By Stage 6 both
# tables are empty.
#
# A parse error for anything OUTSIDE the pending list — or a PENDING
# member that no longer fails the way its own reason says it should, or a
# REAL_PARITY_MEMBERS entry whose output doesn't byte-match — is a spec
# FAILURE with the parser's own stderr inlined, never a silent skip.
# `io: true` — a `cargo build` subprocess spawn is real I/O by this
# suite's own convention (see spec_helper.rb's `io: true` note). The build
# lives in a `before(:context)` hook, not the `describe` body, because
# RSpec still evaluates a group's top-level body while building the
# example tree even when `io: true` excludes every example in it —
# tagging the group alone doesn't stop plain body code from running.

  # EVERY MEMBER WAS PENDING AT STAGE 1, each with the SAME honest reason.
  # STAGE 2 removed "pizzas" — it got a REAL byte-match assertion instead
  # (REAL_PARITY_MEMBERS below). STAGE 3 removed the framework trio
  # ("identity", "governance", "console_settings") the SAME way. STAGE 4
  # removes "banking" — entities, composite identity, process managers,
  # read models with every query option, `provenance`, a nested `policy`,
  # `belongs_to`, and `on`'s blockless form — the deliberately "big one"
  # per the plan.
  #
  # "expression"/"translation" (Stage 3) and, now, "compliance"
  # (Stage 4) ALSO come out here, a genuine bonus neither stage set out
  # to build: a concurrently-landed real corpus member
  # (`examples/compliance/`) that Stage 4's own real construction work
  # (entity/process_manager/read-model-options/provenance/nested-policy)
  # happened to fully cover, confirmed byte-exact against Ruby's own
  # `ir.json` before being moved here — the identical discipline every
  # other REAL_PARITY_MEMBERS entry gets. Leaving a member that
  # demonstrably round-trips marked "pending: not yet implemented" would
  # be exactly the kind of false claim this whole harness exists to make
  # impossible, so it's promoted rather than left stale — this is also
  # exactly the safety net working as designed: it showed up as a
  # spec FAILURE ("a PENDING member that no longer fails the way its own
  # reason says it should") the moment this stage's real construction
  # work made it stop failing, not a silent pass. (A second concurrently-
  # landed bonus member, "interview", was promoted here the same way at
  # the time — the whole Interview domain has since been removed from
  # this repo, taking that entry with it.)
  #
  # STAGE 5 removes EVERY `spec/fixtures/**/*.bluebook` member too — the
  # plan's own Stage 5 was narrowed (see this file's own history/the
  # session that added this comment) to "wire the fixtures in and confirm
  # byte-exactness," since the grammar-chapters half already landed as
  # Stage 3/4 bonuses. All twenty fixtures round-tripped byte-exact
  # against Ruby's own `ir.json` against the parser AS IT ALREADY STOOD,
  # with three small real gaps found and fixed along the way (not
  # overfit to these files alone — each is a genuine, general parser/
  # grammar fix): `transition`'s own Ruby-hash-literal shorthand spelling
  # (`from: "x", to: "y"`, no `=>` at all — `parse::mod::
  # argument_gate_fields_pairs`), `{ ... }` admitted for a `keywords`/
  # `rows` body the same way `do ... end` already was (`value_object(
  # "Name") { attribute :value, String }` — `parse::mod::body_gate`/
  # `parse_nested_body`), a parenless rocket-pair's own nested hash value
  # (`where :"a.b" => { ne: "x" }` — `lex::is_hash_literal_brace`), and
  # `attribute`'s type position admitting a quoted forward-reference
  # string (`attribute :name, "Name"`, a value object declared later in
  # the same aggregate — `syntax.bluebook`'s own new `text`-kind row +
  # `parse::mod::resolve_type_expression`).
  # STAGE 6 removes the LAST member — "bluebook_language", the
  # self-hosted grammar itself — leaving PENDING_MEMBERS EMPTY for good,
  # per the plan. See `REAL_PARITY_MEMBERS`' own comment on the two real
  # constructs this stage's own real parsing work found and built:
  # adjacent-string-literal concatenation across a backslash-continued
  # line, and a bare trailing-comma argument-list continuation with no
  # enclosing bracket at all — both genuinely new, both real corpus
  # syntax (vocabulary.bluebook's own long `RefusalTemplate` wording).
  #
  # "roster" — a LATER bonus, the same shape as "compliance"'s own
  # above: a concurrently-landed real corpus member
  # (`examples/roster/`, literally written AS the block-predicates'
  # own worked example — `.none?`/`.any?`/`.all?`/`.find { |x| … }`
  # over a value-object list, an entity list, and a value-object list
  # holding references, including one block nested inside another) that
  # the block-predicates construction work made fully round-trip. Same
  # discipline as every other promotion here: confirmed byte-exact
  # against Ruby's own `ir.json` before moving out of PENDING_MEMBERS,
  # not left stale — the safety net doing exactly its job, catching a
  # PENDING member that stopped failing the way its own reason claimed.
  #
  # "chess" — a new real corpus member (`examples/chess/`, ADR 0026's
  # own named gap: `entity`, `lifecycle`/`transition`, `policy`, and
  # `ensures` given real, non-contrived work — a piece with no life
  # outside the game that holds it, a status that refuses every illegal
  # jump, turn order and check announced by a policy reacting to a move
  # having happened, and a move whose own postcondition is checked after
  # the fact). Built entirely out of constructs `delegates_to`/`entity`/
  # `lifecycle`/`policy`/`ensures`'s own existing byte-matched users
  # (roster, banking) already exercise, so it round-trips the same way
  # they do — confirmed byte-exact against Ruby's own `ir.json` before
  # being added here rather than left in PENDING_MEMBERS to claim a
  # parser gap this domain does not actually have.
  # "directory" — the corpus's own real `rekey`/`compute` example
  # (`examples/directory/`, the schema-evolution guide's `identified_by
  # :name` -> `identified_by :email` worked example, landed for real —
  # see spec/adapters/driven/postgres_era/directory_rekey_spec.rb).
  # Built entirely out of constructs pizzas'/roster's own byte-matched

  # `ir.json` before being added here, same discipline as every other
  # promotion above, not left in PENDING_MEMBERS to claim a parser gap
  # this domain does not actually have. (Its own translation edge under
