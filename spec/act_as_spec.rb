# §2's demonstration: a caller acting under one role, temporarily assuming
# another to dispatch a command that role does not itself hold — checked
# against Governance's `RoleTransition`, then scoped with
# `Hecks.as_caller`. TWO SEPARATE REGISTRIES, on purpose: Governance's
# own, and Pizzas' — checking authority and dispatching a business command
# are two independent steps an application already coordinates in plain
# Ruby, so nothing here composes them into one registry.
#
# NO CHANGE TO CommandInterpreter, Dispatcher, OR CommandRules::Authorization
# backs this — `Caller.as` already scopes a role to a nested dispatch and
# restores it after, via ordinary Ruby `ensure`, and `refuse_role_mismatch`
# already does nothing when no caller is bound. This spec is the proof: the
# pattern composes out of primitives that already exist.
