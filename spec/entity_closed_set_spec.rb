# A type-position `one_of` on an entity attribute synthesizes a closed-set
# value object — if EntityBuilder built it and then dropped it,
# `Entity.declare` carries no value objects, so the set would exist
# nowhere in the finished graph. The attribute would stay typed at a name
# nothing could resolve — the one_of would be decorative at runtime (no
# admission), and the fuzzer would crash every run on the first domain to
# declare one (a chess King/Rook's own castling flag) with `ValueGenerator
# does not know primitive type "Moved"`. The set instead rides the same
# installer an entity's own identity value object already rides to the
# aggregate.
