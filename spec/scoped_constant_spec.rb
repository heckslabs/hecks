# ADR 0025's second Wave-0 prerequisite (docs/dsl-work-slices.md, S0b):
# without this, first-class events and command references (S6, S7) and
# a constant-typed `admits:` (S3's own half) cannot be spelled as
# constants at all — `Account::Debit` needs `Account` to answer `::`,
# which a bare Symbol (today's whole answer, bluebook_builder.rb's own
# former `resolver = ->(const) { const }`) cannot do.
#
# THE RISK NAMED IN THE DOC, verified here rather than assumed: "a real
# facade method colliding with a declaration-time constant... the
# scenario that broke the earlier attempt was two domains in one
# registry." `attribute_collector.rb`'s own comment on `admits:` records
# that earlier attempt's exact failure — a Module-returning shim worked
# only until ANY facade existed, because `Facade::Surface` installs
# every aggregate name as a TOP-LEVEL constant (both nested under its
# chapter AND bare), so the shim was then simply never reached again.
#
# Fixture names are deliberately unlike anything else in the corpus
# (`ScopedBridge*`) — `Facade::Surface.install` sets REAL top-level
# Ruby constants that outlive this example, in a suite that shares one
# process across every spec file; a generic name ("Widget", "Thing")
# risks colliding with some other file's own fixture.
