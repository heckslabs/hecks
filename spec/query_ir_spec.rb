    # THE TRICKIEST PART OF THIS TOOL — a rule's OWN OBJECT IDENTITY
    # carries no signal by the time any caller reads the registry.
    # `MetaValidator.call` (S14) judges every bluebook by dispatching
    # its own IR into the self-hosted grammar, then rebuilds the whole
    # graph fresh from flat rows (`Assembly.call`) — so a bare
    # `given("x")` reference and its owner's own block declaration,
    # the SAME Ruby object at DSL build time, are already two distinct
    # objects by the time `collect_rules` reads them back. Verified
    # live: `Account`'s OWN "customer is active" given, referenced
    # bare by `Account.Open`/`Account.Credit`/etc., comes back as N
    # distinct objects, not one — this dedup has to work WITHOUT
    # identity, by recognising that every one of those commands shares
    # the SAME OWNER (`Account`), which already carries its own
    # "(declared)" entry for it.
    #
    # `Account`'s "customer is active" is also NOT the whole story:
    # `SafeDepositBox` and `OnboardingCase` each independently declare
    # their OWN "customer is active" with the identical canonical text
    # — three genuinely separate declarations, real corpus duplication
    # the tool is right to surface (`bin/query_ir duplicates`'s own
    # live output lists all three). This test scopes to `Account`
    # alone precisely to isolate "one owner, many referencing
    # commands" from that separate, real, cross-aggregate case.
