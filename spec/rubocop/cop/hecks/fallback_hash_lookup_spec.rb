# { |config| config.include CopHelper; ... }` installs CopHelper's `registry`
# method onto every example group in the whole process the instant this file
# is required, not just this one. That collided in a real, reproducible way
# with unrelated specs elsewhere in this suite that also define their own
# `registry` (a `let(:registry)` or a same-named local var) — `bisect`
# confirmed the resulting failures as order-dependent, and isolating just
# this cop's own describe block (below) to only the two mixins it actually
# needs, `require_relative`'d directly instead of via that global-installing
# file, is the fix: CopHelper/ExpectOffense stay fully functional for this
# cop's own examples, and nothing leaks into any other spec file.
