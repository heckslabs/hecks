# `RuboCop::RSpec::ExpectOffense`/`CopHelper` need RSpec required first — see
# `CopHelper`'s own `extend RSpec::SharedContext`, which blows up with an
# uninitialized-constant `NameError` if `rspec` (pulled in by `spec_helper`
# already, transitively, but named explicitly here since this spec would
# still make sense run in isolation) hasn't defined it yet.
# `Style/FormatStringToken` prefers `%<foo>s` over `%{foo}` — but
# `expect_offense`'s own `**replacements` mechanism (`format_offense`,
# rubocop/rspec/expect_offense.rb) matches the literal text `%{keyword}` in
# the source string via `gsub`, not real `Kernel#format` interpolation, so
# `%<class_name>s` would not be substituted at all here. The template form
# is this file's actual requirement, not a style lapse.
