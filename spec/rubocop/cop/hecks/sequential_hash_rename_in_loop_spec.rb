# directly and including them only in this describe block keeps this cop's

  # `lib/hecks/ports/persistence/plugins/era/lineage.rb`'s own comment on
  # `apply_renames`). Reconstructed here as a fixture, not by reverting the
  # real (already-fixed) method — this spec proves the cop would have
  # caught the bug, not that the bug still exists.

Snapshot every old key's value FIRST, delete all old keys, then write all new keys, so the pass applies as one simultaneous permutation instead of a sequence of edits each stepping on the last.
