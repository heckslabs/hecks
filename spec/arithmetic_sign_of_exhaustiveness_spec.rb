# `Arithmetic#sign_of` would answer decrement's sign for both an unknown
# op name and a declared, real op that carries no sign at all (set/append/
# multiply/clamp/remove) if it relied on `.find(...)&.sign || -1`, which
# can't tell "not found" from "found, sign legitimately nil" apart from
# "found, sign is -1". Both
# callers already gate every non-arithmetic op through their own `case`
# before reaching #sign_of, so this is a direct, no-boot unit test of the
# backstop itself, not a real dispatch path today.
