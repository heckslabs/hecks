# Real dispatch coverage for the aggregate-level none_in_state gap:
# Runtime::QueryInterpreter#holds? (the entity/sub-list query path, and
# the fallback when no adapter implements :query) already had
# none_in_state -- Ports::Query::InMemory#holds? ("the path that
# actually runs for a memory- or heki-backed aggregate query" per its
# own existing comment) never had a matching case, so an ORDINARY
# aggregate-level none_in_state where-clause against a Memory-backed
# aggregate silently fell to the else branch (held == want, an id
# string against "Aggregate:state", never equal) and excluded every
# row, every time. Distinct from spec/query_none_in_state_growth_spec.rb,
# which exercises the entity-level path this gap does not touch.
