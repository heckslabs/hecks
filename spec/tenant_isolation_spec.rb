# THE ARCHITECTURAL FINDING THIS SPEC PROVES, END TO END: hosting
# multitenancy needs no ambient "current tenant" thread-local and no
# adapter-level connection cache — `Bluebook::ProjectRegister` already
# resolves an address's REALM to a DISPATCHER at registration time, and
# each registered entry already carries its own boot's own Registry,
# Dispatcher, and adapter instances. So booting the SAME domain
# directory once PER TENANT, each with its own `environment:` overlay
# (realm + persistence settings, both built in the previous slice —
# see Runtime::Loader.boot's own comment), and registering every boot
# into ONE shared ProjectRegister, gives real, physical multitenancy
# through mechanisms that already existed and were already tested for
# something else (Router's realm-keyed dispatch, PostgresEra's `schema:`
# Storehouse isolation) before this spec ever ran.
#
# Runtime::TenantCheck#tenant_capable? is the one genuinely new piece:
# the gate that refuses to trust this pattern for a domain bound to an
# adapter that does NOT keep two boots' data apart (a hypothetical
# adapter with process-wide state, or one with no per-boot isolation
# setting at all).
