# it — `Kernel.load` is the one Ruby primitive that loads a plain path
# regardless of extension, and it's what the script's own
# `$PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__` guard exists for: loaded (not run) here, its
# file-writing side effect never fires, only `Projections::ParserTable` gets
# defined.

# Grammar drift fails the normal suite immediately, not "someone eventually
# notices". rust/parser/src/keywords.rs is generated from the aggregate-local syntax tables
# by bin/project_parser_table (see that file's own header) — this spec
# regenerates it into memory and asserts byte equality with the committed
# file. A syntax-table change that lands without re-running
# `bin/project_parser_table` fails here, in the loop every push already
# runs, rather than silently leaving the Rust parser's own word/argument
# knowledge stale.
