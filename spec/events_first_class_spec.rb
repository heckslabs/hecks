# ADR 0025, S6 — "events first-class". Scope-narrowed pass, 2026-08-27:
# `emits`/`on` accept a bare event constant (`emits Account::AccountFrozen`,
# `on Account::AccountFrozen`), resolved the same way `trigger`/`dispatch`
# already resolve a command reference (`Naming.event_ref`, ConstShim).
# UNLIKE command references, the old quoted-string form is NOT refused —
# only command references were 100% corpus-migrated, so refusing the old
# spelling for events would break every live site this pass didn't touch.
# Both forms stay admitted; see policy.bluebook's own KeywordSeed comment.
