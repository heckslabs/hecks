# WHAT THE DOMAIN FREEZES, ASSERTED AGAINST A REAL DISPATCH.
#
# Freezing has been fixed four times in four places — list attributes,
# the event log, query rows, value objects — and each fix topped the
# container and left the contents. `.freeze` on a Hash stops a key being
# added or removed and nothing else, so a caller reaches through and
# edits in place. Every one of those fixes looked complete.
#
# So this asks the question of a REAL result rather than a constructed
# one, and asks it about the whole reachable graph rather than the object
# on top.
