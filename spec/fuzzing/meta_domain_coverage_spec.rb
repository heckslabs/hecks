# THE GATE THAT AUTOMATES THE THING THIS ARC EXISTS FOR — "we don't do
# a good job of adding the properties when we add to the language."
# `Bluebook::MetaValidator.grammar_registry` IS the language (that
# module's own header: "the language IS the source" — every real
# bluebook is judged against it, and it is loaded from the SAME
# `language/bluebook/*.bluebook` files whether a domain author or this
# spec asks). So every construct and attribute the language can ever
# declare is enumerable, mechanically, with no second list to keep in
# sync by hand — which is exactly the list `combination_coverage_spec.rb`
# already keeps BY HAND for pairwise form coverage (that file's own
# header: "Adding a property here is how a new form joins the gate").
#
# This spec closes the gap one level up: not "is this form exercised at
# all," but "does a REAL RUN'S invariant exist for this feature, or was
# it left unchecked." `Properties::FEATURE_COVERAGE` is the CLAIM —
# which property answers for which "Construct#attribute" — and this
# spec is the only thing that reads BOTH the claim and the grammar and
# refuses to let them drift apart silently:
#
#   * a claimed feature that no longer exists in the grammar (renamed,
#     removed) fails LOUDLY here, not by quietly protecting nothing
#   * a feature the grammar adds that nobody claims, and that isn't an
#     explicitly reasoned EXEMPTION or a named, honest KNOWN_GAP, fails
#     here too — the moment it lands, not whenever someone remembers to
#     go looking
#
# META_DOMAIN_KNOWN_GAPS is not a place to hide an unclaimed feature — it is a
# VISIBLE, itemized admission ("this needs a property, this session did
# not write one, here is why it's not a property yet"), the same
# distinction `spec/combination_coverage_spec.rb`'s own "unmet on
# purpose — and empty, which is the position to defend" makes for its
# own gate.
