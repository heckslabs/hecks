# Every VERB the language declares must be OFFERED to it.
#
# A rule the judge never dispatches input to cannot fire. That has now happened
# three times in this validator. Five rules were declared and unreachable after
# the first pass. Policies, process managers and entities went unjudged after
# the second — banking's three policies and its Settlement saga passed through
# validation untouched, so any rule about them was decoration. This spec was
# written to catch the third, and did not, because it guarded only `*.Declare`:
# thirteen verbs — among them `Command.Argument` and `ValueObject.Field`, so a
# command's own arguments and a value object's own fields were NEVER judged —
# sat declared and unreachable underneath a green guard.
#
# So the map is gone. Nothing here is hand-kept any more: the expectation is
# DERIVED from the language, and a verb the language declares is a verb the
# judge owes an offer. Adding a command to bluebook.bluebook without teaching
# the judge to offer it is exactly the failure this catches, and now it catches
# it at the grain of the verb rather than the grain of the category.
#
# `experiment/replay.rb` used to catch this indirectly: it rebuilt the IR from
# the meta-domain and diffed, so a dropped category stopped matching. That is a
# lot of machinery to answer a question this asks directly, and the reconstruction
# half was never needed for validation. This replaces it.
