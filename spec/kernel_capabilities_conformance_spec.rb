# `bin/project_kernel_capabilities` generates `rust/src/kernel/
# attribute_shapes/mod.rs` and `rust/src/kernel/expression_operators/
# mod.rs` from two live Ruby ground truths — `Coercion::SHAPES` and
# `Grammar.admitted_operators`'s own `category` field — but nothing held
# the checked-in generated files to those ground truths the way
# spec/vocabulary_conformance_spec.rb holds other tables to their own
# live constants. Item #8, whole-project table-unification survey:
# confirmed current (zero drift) when investigated, but the investigation
# itself found no automated gate — exactly the same shape item #2's real,
# 39-vs-42-entry refusal-wording drift went unnoticed for. This closes
# that gap the same way: read the checked-in file's own `pub mod <name>;`
# roster (the one line per capability this generator's own `emit_mod`
# writes, in Ruby's own current order) and hold it to the live Ruby
# table, both directions.
