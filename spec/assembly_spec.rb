# A GRAPH ASSEMBLED FROM DECLARATIONS IS THE GRAPH THE BUILDER MAKES.
#
# `Assembly` takes the hash `to_h` spells and returns the object graph the runtime
# runs. That makes it the exact inverse of `to_h`, and this holds it to that for
# every chapter in the tree:
#
#     Assembly.call(built.to_h).to_h == built.to_h
#
# It is tested against the BUILDER's hash rather than the meta-domain's on purpose.
# The two are already proven byte-identical and unsorted by spec/round_trip_spec, so
# feeding the builder's keeps this spec about one thing — whether declarations
# rebuild into objects faithfully — instead of two.
#
# Every chapter, not the four the round trip walks: a shape only one bluebook
# exercises is exactly the shape a partial corpus lets through.
