# A port generator learns by example, and the examples are only as good
# as what they cover. Every real gap `bin/project_rust` hit while
# building the Rust port turned out to be a shape neither example
# domain exercised: composite identity that's actually dispatchable
# (SafeDepositBox's is blocked by entities), a multi-field closed set,
# a bare-but-declared identity component. Each one was a real Ruby
# mechanism, already correct, that simply hadn't been walked before.
#
# This is the gate against that happening again, silently. It reads
# Banking's own exported IR and checks it against the list of
# structural shapes a second runtime has to handle differently —
# not every DSL keyword (`spec/syntax_conformance_spec.rb` already
# holds those to the language), but every shape of IR a port's
# generator branches on. Both directions matter, the same as
# `ModelCheck::ALLOWED_FINDINGS`: a shape Banking stops exercising
# is a regression; a shape found missing has to be added to Banking,
# or named here as a deliberate, accepted gap — never silently absent.
RSpec.describe "the shapes a port generator needs Banking to exercise" do
  # Booted once per file, not per example — every example here only reads
  # the exported IR back out (`ir`, `all_value_objects`, `all_attributes`
  # below), nothing dispatches a command, so a shared registry is safe.
