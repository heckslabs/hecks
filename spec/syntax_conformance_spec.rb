# The declared syntax must equal the surface the builders actually answer.
#
# `language/bluebook/syntax.bluebook` says how a bluebook is SPELLED — every
# word, the body it opens, the arguments it takes. Nothing else in this project
# says that. The builders are where the spelling really lives, and before this
# spec the declaration and the builders had never been held to each other —
# a near-miss list could only be kept by hand "because nothing declares
# what the keywords are".
#
# This is the same shape as spec/vocabulary_conformance_spec, for the same
# reason: a declaration nothing reads cannot disagree with anything. It reads
# the syntax out of the meta-domain's IR and holds the live builders to it.
# Declare a word no builder answers and this fails ; grow a builder a word the
# language does not declare and this fails too.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, DELIBERATELY. The one-way version — "everything declared
# exists" — is the one that lets the surface drift: a word added to a builder
# and not to the language is invisible to anything projected from the language,
# which is precisely the class of bug that made the parser unprojectable.
