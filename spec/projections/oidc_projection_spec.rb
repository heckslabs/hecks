# spec/oidc_projection_spec.rb already covers. That one proves a verified
# (issuer, subject) resolves to an identity, that the identity's role is
# checked, and that the dispatch is refused when either says no. It just
# had no way to state, up front and as data, which role each command
# wants — every answer came from making a real dispatch and seeing what
# happened.
#
# So the two halves are checked against each other here, not merely
# allowed to coexist: the manifest's verbs are held equal to the
# runtime's own verb list, and its roles are held to be exactly the
# strings the commands declare.
