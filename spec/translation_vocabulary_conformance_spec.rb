# The translation chapter's Rule.Kind closed set must equal the rule
# vocabulary the DSL actually admits.
#
# The two lived apart with nothing holding them together: the grammar chapter
# declared the kinds in an invariant nobody read, and
# TranslationAggregateBuilder re-spelled the same list by hand in its
# method_missing refusal. A declaration nothing reads cannot disagree with
# anything — the same drift vocabulary_conformance_spec.rb exists to stop for
# every other closed set. This is the same gate for the translation sublanguage.

  # either a real public method or one `GenericDispatch` (item #13's full
  # metaprogrammed dispatch) executes off the grammar table directly —
  # `drop` moved to the second kind in slice 2 (whole-project table-
  # unification survey) and no longer shows up in `public_instance_
  # methods` at all, the same way `WordGate`'s own admissibility check
  # never counted `method_missing` itself as an answered word. `unresolved`
  # (slice 4) and `rename`/`move`/`convert`/`retype`/`compute`/`rekey`/
  # `backfill` (slice 4c) all moved to the same second kind, but (unlike
  # `drop`) each kept a real, directly-defined method — just renamed to
  # `*_impl` and reached through `calls:` — so every one of those names has
  # to be excluded from the direct-methods half here too, or it would show
  # up as an extra "word" of its own alongside the one GENERIC_DISPATCH.
  # handles? already adds.
