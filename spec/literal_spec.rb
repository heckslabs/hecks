# The wire spelling itself, held still.
#
# Every other spec that touches these strings reaches them through a domain
# boot, so the only thing pinning the format was a golden file — and a golden
# regenerates. This is the claim: these exact spellings, on any Ruby. The
# renderings this replaced were `Hash#inspect` and `Symbol#to_s`, which meant
# the wire format quietly said whatever the interpreter said — 3.3 spells the
# same Hash `{:k=>"v"}` and 3.4 spells it `{k: "v"}`.
