# A FORM EXERCISED ALONE IS NOT A FORM EXERCISED.
#
# The third coverage gate, and the one the other two set up. `plurality` asks
# whether a declared list is ever filled twice. `optionality` asks whether a
# nullable field is ever filled at all. Both measure one property at a time —
# and every defect this arc found lived where two met:
#
#   a composite identity  ×  a hand-written parser  the block was never consumed,
#                                                 and the aggregate came back empty
#   a composite identity  ×  an entity            the element matched on the
#                                                 first part of the piece's id
#   two events            ×  a reaction           nothing had ever ordered two
#                                                 announcements from one dispatch
#   a plain argument      ×  a cross-reference    the derived attribute ORDER
#                                                 came out wrong, and only because
#                                                 no command had ever declared them
#                                                 in that order
#
# The last one is this spec's own catch, and it is the argument for the whole
# idea: a reader can be right about references and right about arguments, and
# wrong the first time a command puts an argument before a reference.
#
# PAIRWISE, NOT EVERY SUBSET. Thirteen properties is 78 pairs and 8192 subsets;
# pairwise is the standard tractable cut and it is where the interactions above
# actually lived. It is also cheap to satisfy well: the corpus went from 27
# uncovered pairs to 3 by enriching ONE aggregate, because the gaps cluster
# around the rare forms rather than spreading evenly.
#
# THE UNIT IS ONE AGGREGATE. Two forms in the same chapter but different heads
# never meet at dispatch; two forms on one head do.
RSpec.describe "every pair of declared forms, met on one aggregate" do
  # WHAT AN AGGREGATE CAN EXHIBIT. Each entry is a form the language declares
  # and a runtime has to handle — chosen because it has produced a defect, or
  # sits one step from one. Adding a property here is how a new form joins the
  # gate; it will name its own uncovered pairs on the first run.
  #
  # ONE FLAT TABLE, ON PURPOSE — each entry is an independent boolean check
  # against the same `aggregate`, laid out so every declared form can be read
  # (and added to) at a glance. Splitting this into one method per property
  # would scatter the table this comment describes across a dozen tiny
  # methods for no gain — there is no shared state or ordering between
  # entries to protect by keeping them apart.

      These forms are each exercised somewhere, and never on the SAME aggregate:

        #{unnamed.map { |left, right| "#{left} + #{right}" }.join("\n        ")}

      A runtime can be right about each form alone and wrong about the two
      together — that is how a command declaring an argument before a
      cross-reference put the derived attribute order out of step, having
      been right on every command in the corpus that declared them the other way.

      Closing these is cheaper than it looks: the gaps cluster on the rare forms,
      so enriching one aggregate that already carries a rare one usually closes
      many pairs at once. Otherwise add an entry to ALLOWED_APART, keyed
      "left + right" alphabetically, saying why the two need not meet.
