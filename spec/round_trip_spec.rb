# THE SELF-HOSTING CLAIM, stated as a test.
#
# `bluebook.bluebook` opens with it: "loading a domain becomes dispatching commands
# into this meta-domain ; the IR it stores must equal the IR the DSL builder
# produces." The judge dispatches a bluebook in. Reconstruction reads it back out.
# This compares the two, and there is no longer any difference to explain.
#
# It began as pizzas exact and banking eight short, with the eight named as an exact
# classified set — an entity's own commands, queries and lifecycle, a non-string
# default, a literal with structure. Each turned out to be either a field the
# language had no room for or a value stored as text that forgot its own type. All
# four members now come back byte for byte.
#
# The fixtures are here on purpose. Banking has no aggregate attribute carrying a
# default, so `Field#default` would have been legal and unexercised — the exact
# pattern this project keeps finding — and till declares
# `attribute :balance, Money, default: { cents: 0 }`, which exercises both the field
# and the object-literal encoding at once.

  # generically through `Assembly::Contracts`'s own data-driven
  # `declaration()` — and once silently dropped `invariants`/
  # `preconditions` for exactly this reason (S10/S12): the judge
  # correctly dispatched them, Reconstruction just never asked. `entity
  # (row)` is the SAME hand-typed shape, one level down, and repeated
  # the identical gap for `preconditions` this session (ADR 0028) —
  # found by re-deriving the fix from memory of the Aggregate bug, not
  # by a gate catching it fresh. THIS is that gate: checked
  # structurally, against `ir_spec` (what the REAL Ruby class declares
  # it emits), so a dropped key fails here regardless of whether any
  # fixture's own content happens to populate that field — the round-
  # trip test above only catches a VALUE mismatch, never an ABSENT KEY.
  #
  # Scoped to the two constructs actually hand-typed today. A construct
  # read through `Assembly::Contracts`'s generic path isn't structurally
  # immune to the same class of bug, but its `fields:` hash is data a
  # reviewer diffs directly against `ir_spec`, not free-hand Ruby a
  # silent `return` can quietly under-populate — a materially different
