# The language does not only judge a bluebook — it holds one, and gives it back.
#
# `bluebook.bluebook`'s own vision says "loading a domain becomes dispatching
# commands into this meta-domain ; the IR it stores must equal the IR the DSL
# builder produces." Only the first half was true. The judge dispatched every
# declaration in, collected refusals, and threw the records away — which is all
# judging needs, and exactly why the language could only validate.
#
# The reason was structural and slightly absurd: the meta-domain declared twelve
# categories and thirty-four verbs and not one query. It was write-only. A store
# you cannot read cannot be the source of anything.
#
# So the way back is declared, on the aggregates themselves, and read through
# their own front doors rather than by reaching into a repository. This spec is
# the first slice of it: the chapter and its aggregates come back out. The
# remaining categories, and equality with the builder's whole `to_h`, are the arc
# this opens — not a claim it already makes.
