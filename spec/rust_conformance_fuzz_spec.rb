# PRD 04 (rust-conformance-fuzzing) — spec/rust_conformance_spec.rb only
# ever compares Ruby vs. Rust over a FIXED, hand-authored corpus.
# `Hecks::Fuzzing::SequenceGenerator`'s randomly generated sequences never
# reached it before this file — meaning the single highest-leverage check
# in the whole equivalence-gap plan (per its own text: "it would have
# caught most of today's [nine] bugs automatically instead of needing
# manual investigation") didn't exist yet. This is that bridge: generate
# N seeded sequences per domain, run each through BOTH `Replay.call` and
# the compiled Rust conformance binary, diff the same way
# rust_conformance_spec.rb already does (shared helpers, not re-derived —
# see support/rust_conformance_helpers.rb).
#
# `bin/fuzz`'s own header used to say this comparison "no longer exists"
# (true the first time Rust was retired — docs/implemented/
# rust-experiment.md — stale the moment Rust came back, 2026-08-07; fixed
# alongside this file, see that script's own updated header).
#
# `io: true` — a real `cargo build` per domain feature, same as
# rust_conformance_spec.rb; excluded locally by default, always run in
# CI. Deliberately its OWN file rather than folded into
# rust_conformance_spec.rb: that file's job is proving byte-for-byte
# agreement on a small, fully-understood, hand-curated corpus; this file's
# job is FINDING divergences an unbounded input space could still be
# hiding — different intent, kept visually and organizationally separate.
#
# BOTH examples are `pending:` today — the very first real run already
# found real, confirmed divergences too broad to filter honestly (ADR
# 0037 has the full catalogue: which ones, why they're not fixed yet,
# what fixing each needs, in priority order). This is a working,
# proven bridge that found real bugs immediately, not a stalled or
# half-built feature — un-pend an example locally after closing one of
# ADR 0037's findings to confirm it, the same red-before/green-after
# discipline every other fix in this plan used.
