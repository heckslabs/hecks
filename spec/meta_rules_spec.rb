# The language's rules, expressed in the language.
#
# Seventeen rules live as `raise Malformed` across seven builder files. Stage
# one of defining the language in itself is porting them into the meta-domain
# as `given` and `invariant`, where they are declarations rather than code —
# facts any reader of the meta-domain can consume, instead of behavior buried
# in the builders.
#
# Every rule here must be SEEN REFUSING. A ported rule that never fires is the
# same defect the whole corpus keeps producing, and porting rules is exactly
# the activity most likely to produce it.
