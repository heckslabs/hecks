  module Adapters
    # THE DETERMINISTIC `agent` FULFILLMENT — a hand-loaded queue of raw
    # answers, one queue per operation, so a spec (or `bin/interview`
    # run against it deliberately) can assert on an EXACT question,
    # proposal, finding, or suggestion with no live model in the room.
    # `reset!` mirrors `SequentialIdentity`'s own convention: this
    # module's state is class-level, not per-boot, so a spec that wants
    # a clean queue calls it explicitly.
    #
    # RETURNS RAW HASHES, same shape a real `claude` reply unwraps to —
    # this double stands in for `ClaudeCode.call`, not for
    # `Ports::Agent`'s own validation, so a scripted answer still has to
    # survive `Ports::Agent::Answers` exactly like a live one does. A
    # spec proving the loop works against this double is also,
    # incidentally, a spec proving the validation is real.
    #
    # NEVER required from `driven.rb`, the same trap `SequentialIdentity`
    # already documents there: a second adapter answering the `agent`
    # port unconditionally would make the port permanently ambiguous
    # for every consumer, not just the specs that asked for this one.
