# S16, ADR 0026 — "THE LANGUAGE USES EVERYTHING IT DECLARES, AND WHAT IT
# DOES NOT USE IS A SUB-LANGUAGE."
#
# Modelled directly on `spec/fuzzing/meta_domain_coverage_spec.rb`'s own
# shape (that file's own header: "requires every declared feature to be
# claimed, guaranteed by construction, structurally exempt, or a named
# gap carrying a one-line reason") — aimed here at a different question:
# not "does a property exist for this attribute," but "does the
# LANGUAGE'S OWN description of itself actually declare an instance of
# this CONSTRUCT KIND," counted the same way ADR 0026's own table was
# measured — "counting real declarations rather than grammar rows."
#
# `entity`/`lifecycle`/`transition` are the two gaps this ADR itself
# names as already closed by the two remodels it commissions (S17, S14)
# — this spec is what makes "closed" a checked fact rather than a claim
# in a commit message. The rest — `policy`/`process_manager`/`ensures`/
# `provenance`/`group_by`/`authorize`/`generic` — are the ADR's own
# remaining list, ADOPTED where a real, non-decorative use exists (S16
# added one: `ensures` on `Bluebook.Attach`) and NAMED where it does
# not — the ADR itself warns against the alternative ("Forcing every
# construct into the language... is decoration... modelling to satisfy
# a tool"). `generic` is the ADR's own Consequences section, named
# explicitly there ("a candidate for demotion rather than adoption")
# rather than in its main table, which is why it was missing here until
# this session verified it against the live grammar and found the same
# zero the ADR predicted.
#
# SCOPED TO THE CORE, NOT EVERY ATTACHED SUB-LANGUAGE — the ADR leaves
# this open ("Whether the self-use gate applies to each sub-language
# against its own corpus, or only to the core") and this spec answers
# it: only the core (`LANGUAGE_CHAPTERS` — Bluebook/World/Hecksagon).
# `Paging` contributes grammar ROWS as DATA (`member word: "limit", ...`)
# — it does not itself declare NEW policy/process_manager/entity/etc.
# constructs that would need a self-use claim of their own, and
# extending the gate to every future attached chapter is real, separate
# design work the ADR names as unsettled, not something this slice
# should decide by accident.
#
# CONSTANTS PREFIXED `SELF_USE_` ON PURPOSE — `describe do ... end`'s
# block does not open a new lexical scope for constant assignment the
# way `class`/`module` does, so a bare `LANGUAGE =`/`KNOWN_GAPS =` here
# lands on the top-level Object namespace and silently collides with
# any other spec file's own same-named constant (found for real:
# `spec/orchestration_spec.rb` already declares both).
