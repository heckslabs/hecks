# `AppendOnly#record_event` used to be an endless method with a trailing
# `if` modifier — `def record_event(event) = @adapter.record_event(event)
# if @adapter.respond_to?(:record_event)`. That modifier binds to the
# whole `def`, not just its body, so it evaluated `@adapter.respond_to?`
# against `@adapter` at class-body time (still nil, before any instance
# exists) and silently skipped defining the method at all — the exact
# gotcha `events` right above it in append_only.rb already carries a
# comment warning about. Every adapter's own `record_event` (Memory,
# Postgres, PostgresEra, Sqlite, D1) was, and is, written correctly;
# `emission.rb`'s `repository.record_event(event) if
# repository.respond_to?(:record_event)` simply never reached them,
# because `repository` (the AppendOnly wrapper) never answered true to
# that `respond_to?` check. Every declared `emits` was still computed and
# reported (`registry.event_log`, an in-process array gone at exit) —
# just never durably recorded. Caught live: a tail of a domain's own
# persisted events found nothing to tail.
#
# `sqlite_spec.rb`/`postgres_spec.rb`/`postgres_era_spec.rb` all call
# `adapter.record_event` directly, bypassing this wrapper entirely —
# which is exactly why none of them noticed. This spec goes through the
# wrapper, the way a real dispatch (`Runtime::CommandRules::Emission#emit`)
# always does.
