# `Ports::Persistence::RemoteRuntime` — the shared shape for "the real
# interpreter lives behind a call boundary," named so it's a real,
# checkable capability (`registry.adapter_class(name) <= RemoteRuntime`,
# `Runtime::RemoteDispatcher`'s own use) rather than one adapter's own
# ad hoc raise/[] implementation compared by name. Proven against a bare
# double first (the module's own contract shouldn't need a live AWS
# client to prove), then against the two real adapters that answer this
# capability question differently.
