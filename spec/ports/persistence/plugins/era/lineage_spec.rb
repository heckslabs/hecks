# M27 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md,
# docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md) — `Lineage#translate` applied
# `@renames` sequentially, in-place, against the same hash it was still
# reading from: `state[new_name] = state.delete(old_name)` per rule, one
# rule at a time. A swap (`rename :a, to: :b` alongside `rename :b,
# to: :a`) on `{a: 1, b: 2}` used to produce `{a: 1}` — the first rule
# wrote over `:b`'s real value before the second rule ever got to read
# it, so `b`'s original value (2) vanished outright. Layer 2 audits the
# compiled SQL against this exact reference transform (`layer_two.rb`),
# so the bug wasn't merely wrong — it was self-consistent: the SQL and
# this Ruby reference agreed on the lossy answer, and a mint holding a
# genuine data-losing rename sailed through silently.
#
# The fix computes the full old-name -> value mapping first (a
# snapshot untouched by either pass), removes every old key, and only
# then writes every new key — so a rename never reads a key this same
# pass already wrote to, and a swap or a longer chain applies as one
# simultaneous permutation rather than a sequence of edits each
# stepping on the last.
