# M26 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md,
# docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md) — Layer 1's lifecycle-value check
# compared a translated record's stored state against `Lifecycle#states`
# (default + every declared target only). A state legitimately declared
# solely as a transition's `from:` — a real, reachable value this era's
# own lifecycle names, just never as anyone's target — was never in that
# set, so a perfectly valid record holding it was reported as a violation
# and blocked the mint. `Bluebook::ModelCheck.full_states` is the
# established fix for this exact hole (see its own comment, and
# `fuzzing/properties.rb#lifecycle_values_are_declared`, which already
# uses it for the identical question against a replayed history) — Layer
# 1 must use the same full set, not re-derive a narrower one.
#
# These specs drive `Audit.layer_one!` directly, with a hand-built
# `Bluebook::Lifecycle`/`StateTransition` pair and a minimal aggregate
# double — no bluebook DSL boot needed, same convention as
# layer_two_spec.rb / unfed_report_spec.rb.
RSpec.describe "Layer 1's lifecycle-value check against the full declared state set" do
  # `attribute(_name) => nil` makes `Runtime::Instance` skip both
  # coercion (`Value.hydrate` leaves an unrecognized key's value as-is)
  # and identity materialization (a nil `attribute` short-circuits
  # `materialize_identity!` immediately) — exactly what a bare
  # lifecycle-only fixture needs, without dragging in the rest of the
  # attribute/value-object machinery `Runtime::Instance` otherwise
  # expects a real `Bluebook::Aggregate` to answer.
