# H5 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md) — a dotted-member compute
# (`price.cents`) exempting the whole top-level attribute (`price`) from
# Layer 2's cross-execution equivalence gate would happen because
# `compute_tops` collapses every compute path down to its first
# `.`-segment before rejecting it from both sides of the comparison. A
# migration that silently nulled or dropped a sibling member of the same
# value object (`price.currency`, never touched by the compute at all)
# would then produce zero violations — exactly the data loss this gate
# exists to catch.
#
# These specs drive `Audit.layer_two!` directly, with plain Ruby
# declared-rule objects and before/after hashes — no Postgres involved.
# Layer 2 is pure in-process comparison; the SQL-execution half of a
# compute rule is exercised separately in
# spec/adapters/driven/postgres_era/lineage_spec.rb.
