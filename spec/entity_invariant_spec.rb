# Round 7 — `EntityBuilder#invariant`: a piece's own shape rule,
# checked against every instance the aggregate holds, at the same two
# checkpoints (after every mutation, before save) the aggregate's own
# invariants already run at. Not a separate enforcement boundary — see
# Admissibility#enforce_invariants' own comment on why this does not
# contradict "there is no separate entity invariant."
#
# Real corpus exercise: SafeDepositBox's own `Visit` — "a written note
# is not blank" — an optional VisitNote a vault officer wrote nothing
# but empty text into.
