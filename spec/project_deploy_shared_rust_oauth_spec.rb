# Regression coverage for the combination bin/project_deploy used to
# refuse outright: a Shared-mode domain (database "Shared") with real
# Google OAuth (web "Rust" + a .env.local carrying GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID).
# The refusal assumed OAuth needed its own NAT Gateway this domain has
# none of in Shared mode — but a Shared-mode rust_web domain's main
# dispatch function already runs inside the OWNER's borrowed private
# subnets/security group, which the owner's own template already
# routes through its NAT Gateway and already permits 443 egress on
# (added there for the owner's own real, live OAuth token-exchange
# bug). Nothing new to provision; this spec exists because the actual
# bug found while lifting the refusal was elsewhere — the Parameters
# section's own `if google_oauth_present ... elsif shared ...` treated
# the two as mutually exclusive, so the "both true" case silently
# dropped one entire set of Parameters even though Resources below
# already referenced them unconditionally. Mirrors
# spec/project_deploy_contract_spec.rb's own fixture-generation
# pattern.
