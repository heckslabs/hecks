# CommandRules::Arithmetic's `current ||= 0` (`#arithmetic`/`#multiply`)
# only ever produced a genuine zero when `amount` was ALSO plain — a
# VO-typed attribute with no declared `default:` (genuinely absent, never
# set) hit a misleading refusal on its very first increment/decrement/
# multiply: "increment needs an Integer, got 500" — true of nothing.
# `amount` (500 cents) was exactly the Integer it named, just still
# wearing the Money wrapper the command's own declared attribute type put
# it in; the real gap was that `current` (a raw `0`, not a Value) could
# never enter the value-object branch alongside it.
#
# `#clamp` already falls through to a raw scalar for the identical absent
# case and lets the mutation applier re-wrap the result into the declared
# VO type on write — this closes the same gap for increment/decrement/
# multiply, by unwrapping `amount`'s own single numeric field rather than
# refusing on it.
