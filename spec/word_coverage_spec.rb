# S13, ADR 0025 — "A word earns its place by being used. A word stays if
# it has a real corpus use AND a running doctest. An external consumer
# outside this repo is a valid exemption from the corpus bar, written
# down and naming the consumer, never assumed." (principle 4)
#
# `bin/doc_coverage`/`spec/reference_golden_spec.rb` already close the
# DOCTEST half — every live word must carry prose AND a fenced, running
# example. Neither checks the OTHER half: a doctest can run against a
# chapter INVENTED for the page alone (`docs/implemented/reference/*.md` do this
# routinely — a synthetic `QueryReference`/`DomainPortReference`/
# `WorldReference` bluebook, declared in the page's own fenced block,
# solely so the harness has something to execute), which satisfies
# `unexemplified` while never once landing in a real bluebook a real
# domain ships. ADR 0025's own "Coverage standard" section names this
# exact failure mode: "The doctest bar alone is what let the inert words
# through — `consistency` had a running example demonstrating it being
# *declared*, which is precisely the thing not in question."
#
# So this asks a DIFFERENT question: does any REAL corpus member — an
# example domain, a grammar chapter, a framework member — actually
# WRITE this word, in its own `.bluebook`/`.hecksagon`/`.world` file? A
# word that only a doc page's own invented fixture exercises answers no,
# and must be named here with a reason, the same shape
# `plurality_coverage_spec.rb`'s ALLOWED_SINGLETON already is for a
# different claim.

    # names this risk) with no context awareness at all, and every one of
    # these words happens to collide with an UNRELATED real corpus use
    # of the same spelling: `retired`/`rename`/`convert`/`drop`/`retype`/
    # `backfill`/`unresolved` all appear as plain STRING VALUES inside
    # lib/hecks/grammar/translation.bluebook's own unrelated `Rule.Kind`
    # closed set (a pre-existing, different self-hosted "Translation"
    # domain — governs proposing/executing/admitting individual rules
    # for bin/evolve's scaffold tooling, never loaded into the same
    # registry as this one) — plus `retired` also collides with the
    # word "retired" appearing as a plain lifecycle STATUS STRING in
    # banking.bluebook/expression.bluebook. Read and confirmed by hand,
    # one file at a time, not assumed: `examples/pizzas/bluebook/
    # translations/2-77625c.bluebook` and `examples/directory/bluebook/
    # translations/2-632545.bluebook` are the two REAL translations
    # this corpus has — a genuine `Hecks.data_translation "Pizzas", ...
    # do aggregate "Order", was: "Pizza" do move ... end end`, and a
    # genuine `Hecks.data_translation "Directory", ... do aggregate
    # "Member" do compute "name", to: "email", sql: "..." ; rekey sql:
    # "..." end end` — which is why `data_translation (File)`,
    # `aggregate (Translation)`, `move (TranslationAggregate)`,
    # `compute (TranslationAggregate)`, and `rekey (TranslationAggregate)`
    # need no exemption here, all five genuinely covered. The remaining
    # rule kinds this language admits have no real edge exercising them
    # anywhere in this repository yet — a real gap in the CORPUS, not
    # in the words.
