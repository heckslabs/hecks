# `Bluebook#to_h` is the wire format two production mechanisms stand on:
# `StorageShape.project` reads it by key name to mint era hashes and detect
# drift (a silently renamed or dropped key would corrupt era identity with no
# error anywhere), and `MetaValidator` hashes it as the verdict-cache key. So
# it is the one shape in this codebase that must never move by accident.
#
# `round_trip_spec` cannot hold it still. It compares the builder's IR against
# the meta-domain's records — two sides both computed fresh at test time, so
# an emission bug on a path the corpus never exercises is simply absent from
# both and passes vacuously. `Field#default` was legal and unexercised for
# precisely that reason. A frozen file is the one check immune to correlated
# drift: it pins today's emission against a reference nothing live can move.
#
# The corpus is every chapter in the tree, not the four `round_trip_spec`
# walks: a shape only one bluebook exercises is exactly the shape a partial
# corpus lets through.
#
# Regenerate deliberately, never casually:
#
#     GOLDEN=rewrite bundle exec rspec spec/ir_golden_spec.rb
#
# A rewrite is a claim that the wire format changed — read the diff before
# trusting it, because every held era's projection was minted off the old one.

  # The guard for the comment above, made executable. Gemfile.lock is
  # gitignored (this is a library gem — Bundler convention holds lockfiles
  # for applications, not gems consumers install), so nothing commits the
  # exact dependency graph that produced these fixtures. What does commit
  # is the Gemfile's own `gem "json", "2.7.2"` — an exact pin (no `~>`),
  # chosen because a newer `json` gem changes `JSON.pretty_generate`'s
  # formatting of an empty array/hash, which would fail every fixture
  # below with a diff that has nothing to do with the wire format
  # actually changing. This spec fails loudly, in this file, if that pin
  # and the resolved gem ever disagree — rather than the failure showing
  # up only as a wall of unrelated-looking byte diffs further down.
