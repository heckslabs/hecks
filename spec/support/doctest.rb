# EXECUTABLE DOCUMENTATION — a guide's fenced examples are extracted and
# run against the real runtime, so a guide that lies goes red in CI. The
# same covenant everything else in this codebase lives under: a
# declaration nothing reads cannot disagree with anything, and prose is
# a declaration.
#
# A guide is a Markdown file whose fences mean:
#
#   ```ruby bluebook   a domain declaration — booted, via its own
#                      Tempfile (Prism's extraction memoises per PATH,
#                      so every block gets a fresh one). Spelled
#                      "ruby bluebook", not bare "bluebook", so a
#                      public renderer (GitHub Pages' Rouge highlighter
#                      reads only the first info-string word) colors it
#                      as the real Ruby it is, the same reason
#                      "ruby boot" / "ruby skip" already do.
#   ```ruby boot       wiring — hecksagon/world blocks, still inside
#                      with_registry
#   ```ruby            usage — runs against the bound runtime, one
#                      shared binding per guide so locals carry across
#                      blocks the way a narrative expects
#   ```ruby skip       shown, never run
#
# and hidden setup lives in an HTML comment:
#
#   <!-- doctest:boot
#   Kernel.load(...)
#   -->
#
# Two claim markers, both required to sit on a SINGLE-LINE expression
# (the transform must preserve the file's line count so a failure names
# the guide's real line):
#
#   expr   # => expected      asserted with == against the expected
#                             text evaluated in the same binding
#   expr   # ~> Klass: text   the expression MUST refuse — class name
#                             (demodulized) and message substring both
#                             checked; not raising is the failure
#
# A guide whose first line is `<!-- doctest: postgres -->` runs only
# when a local Postgres answers, and skips cleanly otherwise.

  # larger dishonesty than skipping it). That real history exists on
  # exactly one machine: whoever's local Postgres lived through the
  # actual pizza migration. A fresh database — CI's, or anyone else's
  # first `createdb hecks_pizzas` — has the schema and none of the
  # history, so this checks for the second era's own row rather than
  # assume reachable Postgres means this specific guide can run. Also a
