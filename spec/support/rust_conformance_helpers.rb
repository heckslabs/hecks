  # never on a record's own `to_h`). They can surface on ANY comparison
  # surface a raw record reaches through — `instances`, but also
  # `queries` (a query answer embeds the same record shape) — so this
  # walks the whole Rust output recursively rather than special-casing
  # each surface one at a time, the same way `bin/rust_conformance`'s own
