  # be silently swallowed by the Kernel method rather than dispatched — no
  # error, no refusal, the transition just never happened.
  #
  # THE FIXTURE IS DELIBERATE, not a convenience. Banking used to be the
  # subject here (`Account.Freeze`, `ExternalTransfer.Send` were the only
  # two colliding verbs in the whole corpus) and both were renamed —
  # domain vocabulary should not be chosen by what Ruby happens to have
  # taken. That leaves nothing shipped to prove this with, and the
  # protection is for somebody ELSE'S domain now : anyone is still free to
  # name a command `Freeze`, so the guard has to keep being tested. A
  # chapter that exists only to collide is the honest way to do that.
