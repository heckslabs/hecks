# The language passes its own rules — and runs from its own records.
#
# `lib/hecks/language/bluebook/` declares what a bluebook is, and
# nine rules are now enforced there and nowhere else. It is itself a bluebook —
# so it must satisfy the rules it declares, or the language demands of every
# domain something its own definition does not do.
#
# The bootstrap loads it raw (judging it while loading it would recurse), but
# the exemption ends there : `grammar_registry` immediately judges the merged
# chapter through itself and keeps the assembled graph, so the language every
# other bluebook is judged by is the one the language itself produced. The
# first example below is the independent proof the judge accepts the chapter (every
# other path is a verdicts-cache hit after boot) ; the last two prove the
# fixpoint is load-bearing, not merely possible.

  # The door-coherence example resets the singleton and binds fresh,
  # deliberately : any spec that binds another runtime repoints the global
  # constants at its surface, so "registry and door agree" is only a fact
  # about the moment just after a bind — which is exactly the moment this
  # asserts, whatever order the suite ran in.
  #
  # Restored after, not just reset before — `@grammar_registry` is process-
  # global and memoized (MetaValidator.grammar_registry's own `||=`), so
  # nil-ing it here forces a genuine rebuild for this example's own purposes,
  # but leaving that rebuild in place afterward means every other spec
  # sharing this process for the rest of its life — including
  # ir_golden_spec.rb's byte-for-byte comparison against a frozen fixture —
  # reads a registry built at this moment in suite history, not the
  # pristine first-boot one the golden fixtures were captured against.
  # Found live: an intermittent ir_golden_spec.rb failure under
  # parallel_rspec, order-dependent on whether this example's process
  # happened to run before it — never reproduced under a plain sequential
  # `bundle exec rspec` because this test and ir_golden_spec.rb only race
  # when parallel_rspec's file-to-process assignment puts them in the same
  # worker. Saving and restoring the singleton (a bare `ensure`, the same
  # shape every other spec here already uses to leave shared state as it
  # found it) makes this example's own deliberate reset invisible to
  # whatever runs after it, in this process or any other.

  # field's real declared type (`Vocabulary::MutationOp`'s own `sign: "1"`
  # is genuinely a String — the language's own grammar says so,

  # value through `unmark_scalar` on the assembled side, on purpose:
  # spec/vocabulary_conformance_spec.rb reads real Ruby `true`/`false`
  # (`compares_less_than: true`, not the source text `"true"`) off exactly
  # this path, and says so in its own header comment. So `raw` and
  # `registry` now genuinely, intentionally disagree on a member field's
  # Ruby type — String there, guessed-typed here — and stringifying both
  # sides' member values before comparing is what still lets this spec
  # hold everything else (every attribute, invariant, closed_set flag,
