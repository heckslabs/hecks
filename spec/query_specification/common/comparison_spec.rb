# M1, M2, M4 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md) — all three were
# reported against `Ports::Query::InMemory`'s own, separate comparator
# copy, before it and `Runtime::QueryInterpreter`'s copy were unified into
# this one shared module (see this file's own header comment). Re-verified
# here against the current, shared implementation: all three are already
# fixed by that unification and this file exists to pin the fix down with
# a real regression test, not to re-fix anything.
