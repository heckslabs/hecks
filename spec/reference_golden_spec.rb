# no prose is a word the language ships undocumented, and that is a

  # where/order_by/limit/offset, and `role`/`goal` on a command), and in
  # both cases the sentences were perfectly good sentences.

  # **Presence only**. That the examples pass is spec/reference_doctest_spec
  # .rb's question, over the same pages. Both are needed and neither is
  # the other: a fence that has never run proves nothing, and a page of
  # passing fences can still leave half the language unexemplified.
