# §11'S INTEGRATION LAYER — everything BETWEEN a verified OIDC token and
# an authorized dispatch. What "verified" means (redirect, code exchange,
# JWT/JWKS signature checking against a live provider) is deliberately
# out of scope: real, security-critical, external-dependency work,
# tracked separately. This starts from claims already in hand, exactly
# the plan doc's own sketch:
#
#   identity = identities.lookup_external(issuer: claims["iss"], subject: claims["sub"])
#   Hecks.as_caller(role: governance.role_for(identity)) { runtime.dispatch(...) }
#
# `lookup_external` is `Ports::IdentityResolution.resolve` ; `role_for`
# is folded into the same check `Ports::Authorization.holds_role?`
# already makes for `act_as` — the model here is "does this identity
# hold the ONE role this command needs," not a single role-per-identity
# lookup, since `RoleAssignment` already supports an actor holding
# several roles at once.
#
# THE REAL, SHIPPED WIRING, same as governance_authorization_spec.rb —
# Banking's own `.hecksagon` already declares `uses_framework
# "Governance"` and `uses_framework "Identity"`, so a plain `Hecks.boot`
# has both in the same registry, and `Fuzzing::IsolatedBoot` keeps a
# Heki-backed boot from touching examples/banking/data/ for real.
