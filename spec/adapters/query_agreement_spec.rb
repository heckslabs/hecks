# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS: every existing adapter spec (postgres_spec.rb,
# sqlite_spec.rb, memory-backed specs elsewhere) proves each adapter
# self-consistent — it asks the adapter a question and checks the
# adapter's OWN answer looks sane. None of them ever checked that Memory,
# Sqlite, and Postgres AGREE WITH EACH OTHER on the same declared query
# over the same records. A self-referential oracle cannot see divergence
# — that is exactly why nested-field query bugs (numeric_field? judging
# only the first path segment, a dotted field silently matching nothing
# in the reference interpreter) shipped silently: nothing ever put two
# engines' answers side by side. This file is that differential gate,
# reborn adapter-vs-adapter instead of Ruby-vs-Rust.
#
# Every case below asserts against a HAND-COMPUTED expected id list —
# not merely "the three adapters agree with each other" — because three
# engines sharing one bug would still "agree" under a pairwise check. The
# expectation is an independent oracle, worked out by hand from the
# fixture table, and cross-adapter agreement follows transitively from
# every engine matching it.
# The reachability probe itself lives in support/postgres_probe.rb,
# shared by every Postgres spec — a real `PG.connect` round trip asking
# the identical question five separate times over was real, redundant
# I/O. LAZY: `postgres_available?` below only calls it from inside a
# hook/example body, never at file-load time — see postgres_probe.rb's
# own header for why that distinction matters even under `io: true`.

# D1 needs real Cloudflare credentials (CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID,
# CLOUDFLARE_D1_DATABASE_ID, CLOUDFLARE_D1_API_TOKEN) — optional, same as
# Postgres above: this gate runs Memory-vs-Sqlite-vs-Postgres agreement on
# any machine, and additionally includes D1 wherever those three env vars
# point at a real, reachable database. Same laziness as Postgres: only a
# module method, memoized once, never a top-level constant — module
# DEFINITION does no I/O, only calling `.available?` does.
