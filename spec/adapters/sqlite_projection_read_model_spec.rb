# M19 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md,
# docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md) — the in-process read-model path
# (`Runtime::ReadModelInterpreter#project`) and SQLite's own native,
# projected-table path (`Adapters::SqliteProjection#query_read_model`)
# used to diverge on two counts once a real `projected_by` binding
# actually routes a read model through the native path (nothing in the
# existing suite did — every other SQLite read-model spec exercises
# SqlitePersistence alone, which has no `query_read_model` at all and so
# always falls back to the in-process loop regardless of adapter):
#
# - a MISSING root reference: in-process refuses with `NotFound`;
#   the native path answered a silent `{root: nil, ...}`.
# - a CHAINED include (a non-root head that references another
#   INCLUDED head rather than the root directly): in-process matches a
#   head against any already-resolved source, root or not; the native
#   path always matched only against the root, so a chained head's own
#   rows came back empty no matter what actually existed.
