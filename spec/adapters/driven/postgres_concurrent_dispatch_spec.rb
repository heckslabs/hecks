# INVESTIGATION: docs/decisions/ (see the concurrency-model ADR/gap writeup
# committed alongside this spec) traced the dispatch pipeline
# (lib/hecks/runtime/command_interpreter.rb) and found no lock, transaction,
# or version check spanning the read (hydrate) and the write (save) for any
# command whose `given`/mutation reads prior aggregate state — which is
# exactly the TRANSACTIONAL_FALLBACK strategy `DependencyPlanning::Plan
# #strategy_for` chooses whenever a command is not state-independent
# (lib/hecks/runtime/dependency_planning.rb:26-31). `Postgres#atomic_put`
# takes a `pg_advisory_xact_lock` (lib/hecks/adapters/driven/postgres.rb:197-218),
# but `Postgres#save` — the path every state-dependent command actually
# takes — takes NO lock at all (postgres.rb:186-189), and the read that
# feeds the `given` check (`CommandInterpreter#hydrate_existing`,
# command_interpreter.rb:271-293, calling `Postgres#find`, postgres.rb:109-114)
# happens entirely before that write-side transaction even opens.
#
# A DELIBERATELY MINIMAL DOMAIN, not examples/banking — Banking::Account
# declares a real, unrelated Postgres adapter gap of its own (a cross-
# aggregate `where(:"customer/status" => ...)` query that
# postgres/schema_builder.rb's own index builder cannot translate, raising
# PG::UndefinedColumn before a single command ever dispatches). Reusing it
# here would make this spec fail for the wrong reason. This fixture
# isolates exactly the one mechanism under investigation: a `given` that
# reads prior aggregate state, on a command Postgres persists through the
# plain, lock-free `save` path.
#
# THIS SPEC DEMONSTRATES THE GAP, IT DOES NOT FIX IT. Two independent
# Dispatcher instances (the same shape two separate application processes
# take in production) both bound to the SAME Postgres database and the same
# "a" account row. Both concurrently dispatch `Debit` for an amount that
# individually satisfies `given("the balance covers it")` against the
# balance each one reads, but which together overdraw the account. A
# correct concurrency model admits exactly one of the two and refuses the
# other, because the second one's real balance (after the first's write)
# no longer covers it. Today, both are admitted — the second Debit's
# `given` is checked against a snapshot a concurrent writer is about to
# make stale, and the dispatcher never re-checks or locks anything in
# between.
