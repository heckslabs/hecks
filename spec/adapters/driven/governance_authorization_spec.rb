# **The real, shipped wiring** — not a hand-composed registry. Banking's own
# `.hecksagon` declares `uses_framework "Governance"` (see
# examples/banking/bluebook/banking.hecksagon), so a plain `Hecks.boot`
# already attaches Governance to the same registry ; `GovernanceAuthorization`
# needs no bridge to a second runtime, just a dispatch against records
# already sitting in the store it is handed. `Fuzzing::IsolatedBoot` is
# what every other spec touching a Heki-backed example already uses to
# avoid writing into the real examples/banking/data/ files — it copies the
# domain to a tmpdir and rebinds every persistence there to Memory ;
# Governance's own hecksagon is Memory already and lives outside the
# copied tree entirely (`Framework.load!` always reaches its real path),
# so nothing about attaching it needs isolating twice.
#
# Covers both halves the port answers: `holds_role?` (RoleAssignment) and
# `authorized_as?` (RoleTransition) — the latter proved end to end as an
# `act_as` flow through the port, the same shape `act_as_spec.rb` proves
# by querying Governance directly (two separate registries, for
# RoleTransition's own reasons — see that file's own header).
