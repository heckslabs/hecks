# THE HEKI/MEMORY COUSIN OF spec/adapters/driven/postgres_concurrent_dispatch_spec.rb
# — same fixture (an "Account" with a state-dependent `Debit`), same
# invariant (two concurrent $6,000 debits against a $10,000 balance must
# never both succeed), but modeling the shape THESE two adapters actually
# have: process-local data, no second process to model, so "concurrent" here
# means real `Thread`s inside ONE process sharing ONE `Registry` (and so the
# SAME adapter instance — `Registry#repository` memoizes), not two separate
# `boot`s the way the Postgres spec needs.
#
# Neither adapter declares `:optimistic_concurrency` — the mechanism under
# test here is `Runtime::AggregateLock`'s per-key `Mutex`
# (`CommandInterpreter#call`/`EntityInterpreter#call`'s own
# `run_dispatch_order_with_isolation`), not CAS+retry. A correctly-held
# lock means the second dispatch's own `hydrate` can never even START until
# the first dispatch's `save` has landed — so, unlike the Postgres spec,
# there is no window where both threads' `find` calls overlap; proving the
# lock works means proving that window CANNOT be forced open, not that a
# retry recovers from it.
