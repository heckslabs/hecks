# `PostgresEra#reset!` against a real lineage-provisioned (FORCE ROW
# LEVEL SECURITY) journal — the journal carries an INSERT policy and a
# SELECT policy (advance_era!, mint_transaction.rb) and NO DELETE
# policy at all, for anyone. A plain `DELETE ... WHERE aggregate = $1`
# from an ordinary connection therefore used to silently match zero
# rows: no privilege error, no exception, `reset!` just returned `self`
# having deleted nothing.
#
# Same non-superuser-owner harness as lineage_spec.rb's own header
# explains: a local dev Postgres user is commonly a superuser (mine
# is), and a superuser bypasses RLS unconditionally regardless of
# FORCE, so "the owner is fenced too" is untestable without a real,
# ordinary, non-superuser owner role.
