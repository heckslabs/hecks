# `EraResolver.check!`'s own `role` lookup — deliberately NOT `io: true`:
# every collaborator that would otherwise need a real Postgres connection
# (connect_for, Lineage) is doubled, so this isolates exactly the one
# thing under test — which settings spelling `role` resolves to — without
# needing a live database.
#
# `role` only ever grants privileges when truthy (`grant_role!(...) if
# role`), so a `false` role and an absent one are downstream-equivalent —
# EXCEPT at the moment of resolution itself: the old `settings[:role] ||
# settings["role"]` would silently substitute the STRING spelling's value
# whenever the symbol spelling held `false`, granting a role nobody asked
# for. That substitution is exactly what this proves does not happen.
