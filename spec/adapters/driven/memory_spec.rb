# `Memory` was the one driven adapter without `reset!` — Postgres/
# PostgresEra/Sqlite/D1 all already have it, and `Ports::Persistence::
# AppendOnly#reset!` already forwards to whichever adapter it wraps,
# raising only when the adapter doesn't respond to `reset!` at all. This
# closes that one gap: a caller that keeps one booted runtime across many
# cases (skipping `load_domain`'s own per-boot cost) can now reset it back
# to the same clean slate a fresh `Hecks.boot` would have given it.
