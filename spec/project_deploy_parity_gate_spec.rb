# Phase 8 (equivalence-gap plan) — "make parity a build gate, not a test
# claim." `bin/project_deploy` used to have zero hook into any Ruby/Rust
# conformance check at all: parity was proven only against CI's fixed
# test corpus, completely decoupled from what a real `sam deploy` was
# about to ship. `bin/project_deploy`'s own generated `deploy:` target
# now runs `bin/rust_conformance` against the SPECIFIC compiled artifact
# ($(WASM)) `build-<LogicalId>` (the same target) just built — not a
# corpus-wide `cargo build`'s own separate binary — before `sam deploy`
# ever runs. See the generator's own "make verify-parity-<LogicalId>"
# comment (bin/project_deploy) for the full design.
#
# Two halves, matching the plan's own verification requirement ("confirm
# the new deploy-time gate actually blocks a deliberately-broken
# artifact... before trusting it in production") — a STRUCTURAL check
# that the generated Makefile actually wires the new target into
# `deploy:`, and a FUNCTIONAL one, proving the underlying mechanism
# (`bin/rust_conformance`'s own exit code) genuinely fails on a real
# mismatch and passes on a real match, not just that the right words
# appear in generated text.
