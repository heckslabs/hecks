# **The model's shape, held to the language that declares it**.
#
# Every construct's `emits_ir` restates what `bluebook.bluebook` already
# says — and the two are allowed to differ, in five specific ways that
# until now lived only as prose in Ruby comments. A generator cannot be
# written against prose, so this is those decisions as data: each
# deviation named, categorised, and checked.
#
# The categories are not invented here. Four of the five already exist
# somewhere: the parent reference is `Construct`'s owner chain, `position`
# is `contracts.rb`'s own `derived: :walk`, the folds are its
# `[:folded, ...]` entries, and containment is `syntax.bluebook`'s
# `context`/`opens` columns. Only "declared but deliberately off the
# wire" had no home at all.

  # source instead of two that have to agree.

  # claims that for Bluebook::DSL, and a top-level constant in a spec is
  # shared with every other spec in the run. Passing alone and failing in
