# FUZZED, NOT HAND-PICKED — tenant_isolation_spec.rb proves isolation
# for one sequential write each; this proves it across many random,
# INTERLEAVED writes to two LIVE tenants at once, across many seeds.
# Interleaving is the part sequential testing can't convincingly rule
# out: a connection or piece of ambient state accidentally shared
# between two boots would most plausibly show up as tenant B seeing
# something tenant A just wrote a moment before it, not as a clean
# before/after leak.
#
# NOT built on Fuzzing::SequenceGenerator/Replay — both are correct and
# heavily used for what they're FOR (generate-a-sequence-then-discard,
# or replay-a-sequence-then-discard; see isolated_boot.rb's own
# header), but neither exposes a live dispatcher after running: the
# boot happens INSIDE `IsolatedBoot.call { |copy| ... }` and the tmpdir
# — and the runtime built on it — is gone the moment that block
# returns. This property needs TWO dispatchers alive across the WHOLE
# interleaved run, then queried at the end, which is a different shape
# from either class's own contract. Retrofitting shared, heavily-relied
# -on fuzzer infrastructure to support a second shape was a bigger,
# riskier change than writing this small, self-contained generator —
# same technique (Random.new(seed), many seeds, real dispatch), a
# fresh instance of it.
