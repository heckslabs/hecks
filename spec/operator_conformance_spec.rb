# The grammar chapter's Operator domain, made load-bearing — BY CHECKING.
#
# lib/hecks/grammar/expression.bluebook has always declared what an
# operator IS: proposed until it reads in every target, admitted after,
# retired when withdrawn. Nothing read it — a content-management domain
# about operators, not the parser itself — and the evaluator's tables were
# free to drift from it (they did once, into DISJOINT sets — see
# vocabulary_conformance_spec's header for that story).
#
# This spec closes the gap at this project's honest claim level,
# agreement by checking: the admission ledger
# (lib/hecks/grammar/expression_operators.json) is replayed through
# the chapter's REAL commands — so every operator the evaluator runs
# passed a live Admit, through the "reads in every target" guard, on
# this very suite run — and the surviving admitted set is held equal to
# the hardcoded tables, both directions. An operator added to the
# evaluator without a ledger admission fails here; an admitted operator
# the evaluator does not implement fails here; a proposed or retired
# operator anywhere in a live table fails here, and that last line is
# the milestone's whole claim.
#
# By-CONSTRUCTION (the evaluator building its table from the chapter) is
# deliberately not attempted: the Prism adapter normalises every
# predicate through CanonicalForm while a bluebook loads, so the
# expression machinery cannot boot the chapter that would configure it —
# hence the checked-in projection (bin/expression_projection).
