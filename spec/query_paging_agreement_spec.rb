# LIMIT AND OFFSET TOGETHER, ON EVERY ENGINE, ANSWERING THE SAME.
#
# `Ports::Query::InMemory` applied `limit` before `offset` — take n, then
# drop m — where `SqlQueryBuilder` emits `LIMIT n OFFSET m`, which SQL
# reads the other way round. So one declaration meant two different
# things depending on where the aggregate happened to be stored, and
# neither engine refused: a short page is indistinguishable from a page
# that genuinely ran out of rows.
#
# The existing adapter-agreement gate did not catch it because nothing in
# the corpus declares BOTH words on one query — banking's `Overdrawn` has
# a limit and no offset, and no query anywhere has an offset with a
# limit. This is that missing case, written as the arithmetic rather than
# as a comparison, so it holds even for an engine nobody has added yet.
