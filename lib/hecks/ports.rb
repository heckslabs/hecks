# Hecks::Ports
#
# The runtime's named boundaries. Each port is a file beside this one —
# `ports/persistence.rb`, `ports/query.rb`, … — and a port with supporting
# cast keeps it in a same-named directory (`ports/persistence/` holds the
# binding policy, the journal-translation lineage, the repository factory).
# The `.port` files beside them are the DSL declarations the meta-validator
# and the Folder adapter load as data.

module Hecks
  # Declared empty here — each `ports/*.rb` file required below reopens it
  # to add its own port; see the header comment above for what a port is.
