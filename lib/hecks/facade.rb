  # Overwrites only what it itself installed (tracked in GENERATED), refuses —
  # with a warning, never a raise — to clobber a constant belonging to user
  # code or the stdlib. Which is why a chapter named `Set` never becomes a
  # constant, and why `Registry` keeps its own table of chapters rather than
  # trusting Ruby's. Each re-install REPLACES the previous boot's entry, so
  # what GENERATED retains is one small facade module per name, not a graph
  # per boot.
