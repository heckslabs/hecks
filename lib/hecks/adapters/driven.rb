# `PostgresEra` is NOT `require_relative`d here — ADR 0033 moved it, and
# the rest of the era/lineage/translation subsystem, behind a loadable
# persistence plugin (`hecks/ports/persistence/plugins/era`) rather than
# requiring every app to carry it whether or not anything ever binds
# `persisted_by "PostgresEra"`. `Module#autoload` is the one-line seam
# that makes that genuinely load-nothing-until-asked instead of pushing
# an explicit `require` onto every one of the ~15 generic `bin/*` tools
# that boot an arbitrary checked-in domain (several of which — pizzas,
# compliance, chess, roster — bind PostgresEra): the FIRST real
# `Adapters.const_get("PostgresEra")` (`registry/verification.rb`'s own
# adapter resolution, unchanged) transparently `require`s the plugin
# entry point, which defines the constant AND calls `register_plugin`
# as its own side effect (`plugins/era.rb`'s last line) — the exact
# same effect an explicit `require "hecks/ports/persistence/plugins/
# era"` has, just deferred to the moment something is actually asked
# for `PostgresEra` rather than sprinkled across every caller that
# might. A domain that never binds it never triggers the autoload, so
# never loads a line of era code — unchanged from ADR 0033's own goal.

# `SequentialIdentity` — the deterministic identity_generation test

# whichever spec wants it: this file's `require_relative` list is what
# `Folder#load_library`'s `.adapter` glob backs, and `.adapter` DSL
# declarations register into every registry any real `Hecks.boot` ever
# builds. Two adapters answering `identity_generation` unconditionally
# would make the port permanently ambiguous — `Ports::IdentityGeneration
# .adapter` refuses to choose between more than one — for every
# consumer, forever, not just specs that want the deterministic one.
