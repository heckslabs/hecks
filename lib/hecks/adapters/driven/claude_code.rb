    # THE REAL `agent` FULFILLMENT — shells out to the `claude` CLI
    # itself, `claude -p --output-format json`, one process per call.
    # `Ports::Agent`'s own scripted double (`spec/fixtures/scripted_
    # agent.{adapter,rb}`) is the deterministic sibling every spec binds
    # instead, the same relationship `SecureRandomIdentity` already has
    # to `SequentialIdentity`.
    #
    # THIS FILE OWNS TRANSPORT ONLY — spawning the process, unwrapping
    # the CLI's own JSON envelope (`{"result": "..."}`) down to the
    # model's raw text, and parsing THAT text as JSON. It hands back a
    # plain Hash. Whether that Hash has the keys a caller asked for, and
    # whether its values are within the closed vocabularies this port
    # recognizes (a critique's `kind`, a proposal's `verb` pattern) is
    # `Ports::Agent::Answers`' job, not this file's — see `ports/agent.rb`'s
    # own header for why that split is load-bearing.
    #
    # `Open3.capture2` with an explicit argv array, never a shell string
    # — the same shape every other subprocess call in this repo already
    # uses (`bin/rust_conformance`), and the reason `claude` being
    # shell-aliased to `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in a
    # human's own terminal never reaches this code at all: an argv spawn
    # invokes the real binary directly, no shell, no alias.
    #
    # `--allowedTools ""` — this adapter asks a question and reads back
    # text; it never wants the model reaching for a tool mid-answer.
