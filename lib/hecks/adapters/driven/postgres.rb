    # The plain Postgres store — flat, one table per aggregate, real
    # typed columns for scalars and jsonb for nested/list attributes,
    # exactly the shape `Sqlite` already made for its own table. Sibling
    # to `PostgresEra` (postgres_era.rb), which is the same database with
    # full lineage/era machinery on top — pick this one unless a domain
    # actually needs to survive a live shape change. See
    # docs/implemented/postgres-era-adapter-split-plan.md for why the two are split.
    #
    # No `hecks_eras`, no lineage, no advisory-lock-per-write for era
    # tracking, no `lineage_capable?`/`era_check!` — this class simply
    # doesn't define those methods at all, and the capability idiom
    # elsewhere already treats their absence as "not lineage-capable".
    #
    # Storage shape (see postgres/schema_builder.rb for the DDL,
    # postgres/codec.rb for the encode/decode):
    # - One real column per attribute, typed for a scalar
    #   (`SQL_TYPES`, `text` default), `jsonb` for a nested (value-object)
    #   or list-typed attribute — never JSON-in-TEXT the way `Sqlite` has
    #   to, since Postgres has a native jsonb type.
    # - `append` and `project` are two real Postgres statements — `save`/
    #   `delete` wrap them in ONE transaction, same "the journal insert
    #   and the snapshot stay atomic" reasoning `PostgresEra#append`'s own
    #   comment gives: a crash between the two must never leave a
    #   half-written state. `append`/`project` stay plain, individually-
    #   callable methods (never wrapping their own transaction) so
    #   `AppendOnly#recover!`'s replay — `project` alone, no `append` —
    #   keeps working the same way it does on every other adapter.
