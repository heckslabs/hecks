    # A BROWSER-HOSTED DOMAIN'S OWN DECLARED INTENT — not a second Memory
    # wearing a different name. Ruby has no way to reach a real browser's
    # `window.localStorage` at all (it is per-tab, per-origin, JS-only,
    # unreachable over any network the way D1's own REST API is) — so
    # this Ruby-side adapter is honestly a stand-in: in-process, ephemeral,
    # mechanically identical to Memory. What earns it a name of its own
    # is what it DECLARES, not what it happens to do in Ruby: `persisted_by
    # "LocalStorage"` says "this domain expects real, durable, single-
    # device storage the moment it's actually running where it's meant to
    # run" — the same distinction Heki (real local durability) already
    # draws against Memory (deliberately ephemeral, test/example-only),
    # one adapter over. `bin/console`, the fuzzer, `spec/`, `bin/
    # model_check` all get a domain that boots and behaves correctly
    # against this adapter; only a real browser gets the real durability.
    #
    # THE REAL BROWSER HALF lives outside this file entirely: `rust/web`'s
    # `dispatch(json)` (docs/implemented/decisions/0015) takes an optional
    # `"seed"` (the exact `"instances"` shape it also answers with) plus
    # `"steps"` — a host rehydrates from a prior snapshot and replays only
    # the new command(s), rather than the whole history every call. A
    # page bound to this adapter is expected to hold that snapshot in
    # `window.localStorage` itself (get on load, set after every
    # `dispatch`) — the seed/instances round trip IS the adapter, once
    # you're in the one runtime that can actually reach the storage this
    # name promises.

      # the small-adapter case that guide names as a fine place to make
