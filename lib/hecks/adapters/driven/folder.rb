      # CHAPTERS FIRST, JUDGED ONCE, THEN EVERYTHING THAT READS THEM.
      # A chapter may be split across files (the language's own grammar is
      # nine), and judging file one before files two-through-nine exist
      # refuses references that are perfectly well declared a file later —
      # see MetaValidator.defer for the whole reasoning. DOMAIN_ORDER
      # already places every `*.bluebook` ahead of hecksagons and worlds,
      # so the window ends at the last chapter pattern rather than at a
      # hand-written list this would otherwise have to keep in step.
      # `environment:` — ONE MORE PAIR OF FILES, LOADED LAST, NOT A GLOB.
      # RECOVERED, not new — see Runtime::Loader.boot's own comment for
      # the provenance. A caller passing `Hecks.boot(path, environment:
      # "production")` gets exactly `environments/production.hecksagon`
      # and `environments/production.world` loaded, whichever exist (a
      # missing one is a silent no-op — not every environment overrides
      # both; see docs/implemented/guides/wiring.md's "Swapping wiring per
      # environment" for the motivating case: swapping a driven adapter
      # — e.g. a real payment gateway for a mock one, or a hosting
      # layer's tenancy settings — without an `if`/`else` anywhere in
      # the domain's own wiring). Never matched by `DOMAIN_ORDER`'s own
      # globs (all non-recursive, none named `environments/*`), so this
      # is the only thing that ever reaches them. Loaded as genuine
      # `Hecks.hecksagon "SameDomain" do ... end` / `Hecks.world
      # "SameDomain" do ... end` blocks — MERGED into the base file's
      # own hecksagon/world (Registry#add_hecksagon / #add_world,
      # concatenate/override rather than replace), so an overlay can
      # rebind or add settings for anything the base file declared
      # without needing to know what else the base file said.

      # is a real file on disk, wherever it actually lives, loaded in place —

      # MARKED BY A `.hecksagon`, NOT BY A `.bluebook`. Chapters are
      # everywhere: era translations, the language's own self-hosted grammar,
      # and `spec/fixtures`, which holds a dozen unrelated ones in a single
      # directory. A `.hecksagon` is the file that says "this is a domain, and

      # caller is relying on when they omit the path.

      # domain directory holding a `bluebook/` subdirectory (every example in

      # the `.hecksagon` is right there, so a plain walk stops on the
      # `bluebook/` directory itself. Both boot identically — `bluebook_directory`
      # accepts either and `Loader.boot` takes `File.dirname` of what it gets,
