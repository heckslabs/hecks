    # to a second runtime. `Runtime::Dispatcher.new(registry)` is cheap
    # to build fresh per call (`Registry#capability_graph`'s own
    # neighbor, `#repository`, does the same kind of on-demand build) —
    # nothing here holds one across calls, so there is no boot-order
    # dependency on when Governance's bluebook loads relative to this
    # adapter, only that it has by the time `holds_role?` is called.
    #
    # An active assignment, not merely a historical one : `RoleAssignment`
    # answers with every assignment an actor has ever held
    # (`AssignmentsForActor`'s own description — "currently or
    # historically") and leaves `ends_at` for the caller to read, the
    # same deferral `Governance::RoleTransition.Allowed` makes for the
    # same reason. This is that caller.
