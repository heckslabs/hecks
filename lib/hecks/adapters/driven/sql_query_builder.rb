  module Adapters
    # The one SQL query compilation, shared by the SQLite and Postgres
    # adapters — each used to carry its own copy of this walk, near-line-
    # identical, and the copies could only drift. Every declared operator
    # compiles fully into SQL or the query refuses loudly; the null-policy
    # predicate, the comma-separated `in` convention, and the identity
    # ORDER BY fallback are spelled once, here.
    #
    # What a dialect actually differs on is narrow, and each adapter
    # supplies exactly those hooks:
    #
    #   placeholder(binds, value)     — "?" or "$N", recording the bind
    #   contains_clause(expr, ph)     — instr() or position(), for a SCALAR field
    #   list_contains_clause(name, member, ph) — real element containment,
    #                                  for a `list_of` field (json_each /
    #                                  jsonb_array_elements)
    #   empty_in_clause               — "0" or "FALSE"
    #   comparable_expression(e, v)   — ::numeric cast, where the dialect casts
    #   plain_column(name)            — a real column or a jsonb path
    #   nested_expression(name, path, member) — json_extract or state #>>
    #   order_clause(order_by, policy)
    #   execute_query(sql, binds)     — run it, return instances
    #   dialect_name                  — for the refusal message
