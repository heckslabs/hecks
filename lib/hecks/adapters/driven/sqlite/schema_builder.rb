        # One field name resolves to exactly one of three outcomes:

        #     — a real btree index on the column, using `plain_column`'s
        #     own `quote_ident(name)` phrasing (reached by calling
        #     `query_expression` itself, not a second copy of its
        #     plain-vs-nested decision);
        #   - a non-list value-object attribute, referenced bare or
        #     through a member path (`field` or `field.member`) — an
        #     EXPRESSION index over `query_expression(field)`'s own
        #     `json_extract(...)` text. Reusing the query compiler's own
        #     expression, not re-deriving the string a second way, is
        #     the whole point: a textual mismatch between the index and
        #     what a real query compiles to is invisible to SQLite's
        #     planner, and two independent copies of this logic can only
        #     drift apart over time;
        #   - a list-typed attribute — NO index. SQLite's `contains`
        #     compiles to `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM json_each(col) WHERE
        #     ...)` (`list_contains_clause`, in `sql_query_builder.rb`)
        #     — an element-membership scan a plain index on the raw
        #     column (or even an expression index on it) does nothing to
        #     speed, since neither indexes the elements individually.
        #     SQLite has no inverted/array index short of FTS5/R-tree,
        #     and neither fits a `list_of` scalar or value-object field
        #     — well beyond this plan's scope. Left unindexed
        #     deliberately, not a silent gap.
        #
        # A field naming neither a real attribute nor the lifecycle
        # field can't happen through the DSL today — `seal_query_field`
        # (`dsl/aggregate_builder.rb`) already refuses it at PARSE time.
