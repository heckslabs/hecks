    # GOOGLE'S OWN OIDC HANDSHAKE — the `authentication` port's one real
    # implementation today, moved here from being hand-rolled per-app
    # (an embryonaut_console `google_auth.rb` used to do exactly this;
    # any hecks-based app gets Google sign-in for free now, the
    # same "one adapter, reusable everywhere" value every other adapter
    # in this directory already has).
    #
    # `oauth2` does ONLY the authorization-code exchange (no Rack
    # middleware, no Omniauth strategy indirection) ; `google-id-token`
    # does ONLY ID-token verification (signature checked against
    # Google's real, rotating JWKS — real, maintained code, never
    # hand-rolled here). Neither library decides what a verified
    # (issuer, subject) MEANS — that's `Ports::IdentityResolution`'s
    # job, called by whoever consumes this port's `verify`.
    #
    # LAZY REQUIRES, same reasoning `Postgres.connect_for` already
    # holds itself to for `pg`: a domain that never binds
    # `authentication` to this adapter should never need these gems
    # installed. This FILE loads in every boot (driven.rb's own
    # unconditional require_relative list) ; the GEMS load only where
    # a real handshake actually happens.
    #
    # `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`/`GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` —
    # no defaults, on purpose: a login mechanism silently
    # half-configured is worse than one that refuses to boot at all.
