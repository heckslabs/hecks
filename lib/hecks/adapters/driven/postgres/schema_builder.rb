        # produce an index below: an entity has no table of its own, its
        # rows live inside a LIST-typed attribute on the AGGREGATE's own
        # table (`QueryInterpreter#entity_rows` resolves it that way, and
        # answers an entity query entirely in memory over `repository.all`
        # — it never reaches this adapter's own `query` method at all).
        # Every list-typed attribute is excluded below regardless (see

        # to "skip" anyway. Walked explicitly rather than silently
