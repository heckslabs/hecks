module Hecks
  # WHAT A CONSTRUCT EMITS, DECLARED RATHER THAN WRITTEN OUT.
  #
  # `IR` is a thing this framework PRODUCES, not a thing its model IS.
  # The language self-hosts, and its own bluebook declares aggregates
  # named `Bluebook`, `Aggregate`, `Command`, `Entity`, `ValueObject`,
  # `Policy`, `ReadModel` — there is no `IR` aggregate anywhere in the
  # grammar. Where the grammar's own vision line does say IR it means the
  # emission: "the IR it STORES must equal the IR the DSL builder
  # PRODUCES". `IR_VERSION` says the same thing structurally — a version
  # stamped on `to_h`'s output rather than on the object is a version of
  # the EMISSION, which only makes sense if the two are different things.
  #
  # So emitting IR is a CAPABILITY a construct has, and this is that
  # capability: `include Hecks::IR` and declare the shape once.
  # The model it emits FROM is `Hecks::Bluebook` — a chapter class
  # nesting everything a chapter declares. It is deliberately not named
  # after this, its own output.
  #
  # Before this, eighteen constructs each hand-wrote a `to_h` that said
  # the same four things in the same order — read a field, recurse into a
  # child, recurse into a list, or compute something — and the shape of a
  # construct was knowable only by reading a method body. Declared, it is
  # data: `ir_spec` can be walked by anything that wants to know what a
  # construct carries, which is the whole point of hanging emission off
  # the model rather than burying it.
  #
  #   include Hecks::IR            # an instance-shaped construct
  #
  #   emits_ir(
  #     name:           :name,                   # send it
  #     identified_by:  :identity_paths,         # ...under a different key
  #     list:           :list?,                  # ...predicates are fine
  #     attributes:     many(:attributes),       # map(&:to_h)
  #     lifecycle:      one(:lifecycle),         # &.to_h, nil-safe
  #     canonical_form: -> { CanonicalForm.table } # anything else
  #   )
  #
  # KEY ORDER IS THE DECLARATION ORDER, and that is load-bearing rather
  # than cosmetic: `spec/golden/ir/*.json` pins the emitted form exactly,
  # so a reordered declaration is a changed artifact and the golden specs
  # will say so.
  module IR
    # THE TWO SHAPES A CONSTRUCT COMES IN, and why this module has two
    # doors instead of hiding the difference.
    #
    # `Bluebook`/`Aggregate`/`Policy`/`ReadModel` are ordinary objects —
    # metadata records, one instance per declaration. `Command`/`Entity`/
    # `ValueObject` are anonymous CLASSES (`Class.new(self)`, see
    # `Command.declare`), because those three are referenced as TYPES in
    # a bluebook (`attribute :price, Money`) and a type has to be a real
    # Ruby constant to be named.
    #
    # That split is real and not worth papering over, so:
    #
    #   include Hecks::IR   # instance-shaped — to_h is an instance method
    #   extend  Hecks::IR   # class-shaped    — to_h is a class method
    #
    # Both get the same `emits_ir` and the same emission rules.

    One  = Struct.new(:source)

    # The declaration side: `emits_ir(**spec)` records a construct's field ->
    # rule map, `many`/`one` wrap a source name so a field can recurse into a
    # list or a single nested construct, and `ir_spec` reads the declaration
    # back — walking the superclass chain so an anonymous `Class.new(base)`
