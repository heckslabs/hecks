module Hecks
  # A named registry of "canonical IR in, external artifact out" tools —
  # §30 of docs/HECKS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Before this existed, every
  # such tool was its own thing with its own call shape: `Exporter`
  # (registry-wide, consumed directly by bin/ir, bin/project_rust, and
  # translation/audit's approval digest — untouched by this file, still
  # exactly what those three read), and `RustProjection::Projector`
  # (`rust/project.rb`, a whole separate Ruby program under a
  # confusingly-identical module name) are the two that already exist.
  # Neither is registered here — retrofitting either is real, separate
  # work (Rust's generator is a whole second toolchain; a UL/OIDC
  # projector doesn't exist yet at all) — but `:ir` is, as a genuine,
  # working, golden-tested example of the shape every future projector
  # (`:rust`, `:ul`, `:openid`, ...) is meant to follow.
  #
  # The unit is ONE bluebook's IR, not a whole booted registry — matching
  # every real projection target (Rust/UL/OIDC all project one domain at
  # a time), and deliberately narrower than `Exporter.call`'s own
  # multi-domain shape.
  # THREE KINDS OF "PROJECT", TOLD APART BY WHAT THEY NEED AS INPUT.
  # Only the first belongs in this registry.
  #
  #   A PROJECTION takes a chapter's DECLARATION and answers something
  #   that DESCRIBES the domain: its IR, its storage shape, an OIDC scope
  #   manifest, the parser's keyword table, the reference pages. Inert,
  #   derived, and runnable against any chapter that carries what it
  #   declares it needs. These are what `register` holds.
  #
  #   AN EXPORT takes a declaration AND its BINDINGS and answers
  #   something that IS the domain, running elsewhere — rust/project.rb's
  #   generated crate, the WASM artifact, the SAM template
  #   bin/project_deploy renders. It needs the `.world`/`.hecksagon` a
  #   projection never looks at, because a running system has to know how
  #   it is wired. That is the whole reason bin/project_deploy cannot use
  #   this protocol: `call(bluebook:, options:)` has no channel for it.
  #
  #   A STATE PROJECTION takes RECORDS — a domain after dispatch — and is
  #   a read-model question wearing the same word.
  #   `bin/expression_projection` is the one of these: its operators are
  #   not declared anywhere, they are what exists after
  #   `Grammar.expression` replays expression_operators.json's ledger of
  #   dispatches. Converting it into this registry would be a category
  #   error, however much its name suggests otherwise.
  #
  # ONE WORD, THREE OTHER MEANINGS — worth naming too, because grepping
  # "projection" turns all of these up and none is the above:
  #
  #   Ports::Projection    read-model catch-up, events folded into state
  #   bin/project          forces that catch-up by hand
  #   RustProjection       rust/project.rb's own separate toolchain

    # answers for an extended module as readily as an included one. This
