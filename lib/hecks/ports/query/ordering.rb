      # What order an ask answers in — the meaning of the ask, not a property
      # of the store that happens to hold it. Declared here once so an adapter
      # may satisfy it natively but never redefine it : SQLite pushes both
      # tiers into SQL (NullPolicy.sql_order renders `field DIR, id DIR`),
      # while Heki and Memory have no query engine and delegate straight back
      # to InMemory.
      #
      # Two tiers, in this order : the declared order_by when there is one,
      # then identity, always. The identity tier is what makes an ask total.
      # Without it, an ask with no order_by — or a declared order with tied
      # keys — hands back whatever order the store happened to hold, and
      # store order was quietly standing in for a rule while every
      # hand-written query in the corpus stayed green : not one of them
      # had a tie for store order to decide.
      #
      # An adapter that pushes ordering down must push limit down with it.
      # Re-ordering a page the store already cut would be a top-N of the
      # wrong N — the one way this can be got quietly, expensively wrong.
