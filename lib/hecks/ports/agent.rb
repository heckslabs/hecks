    # THE INTERVIEWER — whatever asks the next good question, reads a
    # sentence back into proposed declarations, judges a model on taste
    # rather than structure, or suggests a name. Resolved the singleton
    # way every other port here is (`Ports::IdentityGeneration`'s own
    # zero/one/many — one interviewer per process, never per-aggregate),
    # because a second adapter answering this port is exactly as
    # unchoosable as a second one minting identities.
    #
    # BUILT LAST, ON PURPOSE, AND STILL OPTIONAL. `.claude/skills/
    # interview/SKILL.md` conducts a whole session with NONE of this —
    # Claude Code reads `bin/interview state` itself, asks the human
    # directly with real conversation context, and calls `bin/interview
    # ask`/`propose`/`accept` itself. This port exists for what that
    # cannot reach: a HEADLESS run (`bin/interview suggest`, no model in
    # the room otherwise), a batch `critique` over an already-written
    # chapter, and — the actual point of building it at all — a
    # SCRIPTED double (`spec/fixtures/scripted_agent.rb`) that makes the
    # whole loop testable with no real model involved.
    #
    # WHAT THIS PORT IS NOT. It does not judge whether a declaration is
    # WELL-FORMED — that is the meta-domain's own job, answered by a real
    # dispatch refusing or not (`Interview::Session#offer`). This port
    # only ever produces SHAPE: a question, a proposed declaration, a
    # judgement about taste, a name. A proposal naming a category the
    # language does not declare is an ADAPTER fault, refused HERE, in
    # `Answers`; a proposal naming a real category but describing the
    # wrong domain fact is dispatched anyway, so the LANGUAGE gets to say
    # why. That line is the whole design.
    #
    # PARSING BELONGS TO THIS FILE, NOT THE ADAPTER. An adapter answers
    # with a plain, already-JSON-shaped Hash (a real model's parsed
    # reply, or a spec double's own hand-built one) — never a Struct —
    # so every adapter is validated identically here rather than trusting
    # each one to refuse the same way. Two adapters that parsed
    # differently would mean the SAME malformed answer passing through
    # one and refusing through the other.

      # key) wrapped into something this port owns, the same shape
      # `Ports::Authentication::ValidationError` already is, so no
      # caller ever rescues a raw parser error leaking out of an
