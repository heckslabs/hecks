    # TWO YES/NO QUESTIONS AND ONE VALUE an application asks BEFORE
    # binding a caller — resolved the same way `Ports::IdentityGeneration`
    # resolves its own adapter: one adapter registry-wide answers this
    # port, not a per-aggregate binding, since a domain has no reason to
    # want a different authorization source per aggregate. What answers
    # it is deliberately not named here — the governance-backed adapter
    # is one implementation, not the only possible one, the same way
    # `SequentialIdentity` and `SecureRandomIdentity` are two
    # implementations of `identity_generation`.
    #
    # A caller decides what to DO with the answer — dispatch under that
    # role, refuse, log, prefer it over some other fallback value — this
    # only answers the question asked. Nothing here binds a
    # `Runtime::Caller`.
    #
    # STALE AS OF THE `as_of`/`scope` split below, this used to also say
    # nothing here is consulted by `CommandRules::Authorization` — it now
    # is: `refuse_role_mismatch` calls `holds_role?` directly, once a
    # caller binds an `actor_id` and the command's domain has Governance
    # attached (see that rule's own header). `spec/act_as_spec.rb`
    # remains the precedent for the OTHER shape — two separate
    # registries, queried directly by name — for whenever Governance is
    # not in the same boot as the caller; this port is the same
    # questions asked through one adapter when it is.
