  module Ports
    # WHO CAN SIGN IN, AND WHAT ROLE DO THEY HOLD — the domain-specific
    # half of sign-in `Ports::Authentication` deliberately stays out of
    # (see that port's own header: it only ever talks to the external
    # provider, never this registry's own data). Resolved the same way
    # every other port here resolves its adapter: one adapter
    # registry-wide answers this, since an app has no reason to want a
    # different "who's allowed in" source per aggregate.
    #
    # Every domain shapes this differently — who its own "a person who
    # can sign in" aggregate is, what admits them, what grants them
    # access — so this port is pure delegation, same as every sibling
    # port. The one piece of this that IS generic (a live Governance
    # grant should win over whatever an aggregate's own role field
    # says) lives on `Ports::Authorization#live_role_for` instead —
    # a domain's adapter here calls that directly, rather than this
    # port re-deriving Governance-query logic another port already owns.
