    # The shape-drift coverage primitives — ADR 0032. Not a driver: nothing
    # here walks a registry or reads/writes a held snapshot on its own.
    # `PostgresEra::LineageManager::CoverageCheck` calls `uncovered_
    # attributes`/`unsafe_additions`/`refuse_uncovered!`/`refuse_unsafe_
    # addition!`/`check_vanished_aggregates!` directly, per translation
    # edge, over its own DB-held shapes; `Translation::Reattest` and
    # `PostgresEra::LineageManager` call `shadow_parse` directly, to read
    # historical bluebook text under old grammar defaults. Both are real,
    # independent, currently-shipped consumers.
    #
    # A prior version of this module also drove its own top-level check —
    # `check!`/`check_bluebook!`, walking a registry and reading/writing a
    # held snapshot under `data/eras/*.bluebook` — duplicating, on its own,
    # the same per-aggregate walk `CoverageCheck` already performs against
    # `PostgresEra`'s own DB-held shapes. Nothing in production ever called
    # it (only a direct unit spec did); deleted rather than kept unwired,
    # per ADR 0032. Wanted again, it's rebuilt informed by `CoverageCheck`'s
    # real orchestration, not resurrected from here.

      # Parses held source into its own IR, in a scratch registry so a past

      # Normal parse first, shadow only as a fallback — not shadow-parsing
      # unconditionally, which is what this used to do. A handful of DSL
      # defaults fork on `MetaValidator.shadow_parsing?` for a reason
      # that has nothing to do with syntax the live grammar can no longer
      # read at all (`identified_by { }`, `belongs_to`, `has_one`,
      # `has_many` — genuinely removed spellings, exactly what shadow-
      # parsing exists to keep readable): `reference_to`'s own default
      # mint name (`default_reference_name`, attribute_collector.rb)
      # changed from `_id`-suffixed to bare under ADR 0025, and that fork
      # applies even to text using nothing but current, live syntax.
      # Held text minted under the current grammar — every real era in
      # this corpus today, since nothing has ever minted a second one —
      # parses fine normally; only the reference-naming default differed
      # once shadow mode engaged unconditionally, so it silently
      # reconstructed a different shape (and hash) than a fresh parse of
      # the identical text — the same text hashing two different ways
      # depending on which code path read it, breaking `ensure_named!`'s
      # own from/to edge lookup with a spurious "no translation edge
      # covers it" refusal that has nothing to do with any real
      # translation gap.
      #
      # A normal parse can only ever succeed on text the live grammar
      # fully understands — there is no way for it to silently produce a
      # wrong-but-plausible answer for genuinely legacy text, since every
      # removed spelling refuses loudly (`Malformed`) rather than
      # degrading. So: try normal first — if the ordinary grammar reads
      # this text without complaint, that is the canonical, unambiguous
      # interpretation, the same one `label_of`/`mint_hash` on the same
      # source text always computes, whoever's asking. Only on a
      # `Malformed` refusal — the one signal that actually means "this
      # spelling doesn't exist anymore" — fall back to the legacy
      # grammar, exactly as before this change. Any other exception (a
      # genuine syntax error, an unrelated validation refusal) propagates
      # unchanged; swallowing it here to retry under shadow mode would
      # risk masking a real defect in the held text behind a confusing
      # second failure instead of the original, more specific one.
      #
      # `MetaValidator.while_shadow_parsing` (ADR 0025, docs/dsl-work-
      # slices.md's S0a) is what makes the fallback a legacy grammar
      # rather than just a second copy of today's: it stops
      # `BluebookBuilder.build` from judging this text against the
      # grammar as it stands now, which is the one thing that would make
      # a removed spelling refuse history the day it is removed from
      # live source. The scratch registry is throwaway either way —
      # nothing here is dispatched against or exposed to the real one —
      # so skipping the judge/assemble round-trip changes nothing this
      # method reads: `shape`, `uncovered_attributes`, and friends only
      # ever ask the built IR for its own structure.
