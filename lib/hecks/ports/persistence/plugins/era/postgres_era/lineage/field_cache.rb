        # THE READ-SIDE OF THE ERA WORKAROUND. Once a domain mints a
        # second era, `head_view` is a `DISTINCT ON`/`UNION ALL`
        # reduction — and a `where` clause on anything but `id` (its own
        # partition key) cannot be pushed through that reduction, so every
        # declared query pays the cost of reducing the WHOLE aggregate
        # before it can filter anything (see docs/implemented/postgres-era-adapter-
        # split-plan.md's own trigger section — this is a real
        # SQL-semantics wall, not a missing index; adding one to
        # `head_view` itself changes nothing, because the planner cannot
        # prove a predicate on a non-partition column commutes with
        # `DISTINCT ON` without risking a stale row winning).
        #
        # THE WORKAROUND: one narrow table per declared `where`-field
        # (never `order_by`-only fields — sorting the reduced output was
        # never blocked by the reduction; only filtering was), holding
        # exactly (id, ordinal, value) — the CURRENT extracted value for
        # every live id, maintained transactionally by `append` alongside
        # the head snapshot it already upserts (same ordinal-guard idiom:
        # `WHERE ordinal < EXCLUDED.ordinal`). A query whose sole `where`
        # is on a cached field never runs the reduction at all: `SELECT id
        # FROM <field>_cache WHERE value <op> $1`, then `SELECT id, state
        # FROM head_view WHERE id = ANY($ids)` — safe THROUGH the
        # reduction because `id` is its own partition key, unlike the
        # original field.
        #
        # SCOPED TO NON-LIST FIELDS ONLY, same reasoning Track A (plain
        # Postgres) and Track B (Sqlite/D1) both landed on independently
        # for their own automatic indexing: this codebase's `contains`
        # compiles to element-membership (`jsonb_array_elements`/
        # `json_each` + `EXISTS`), which a (id, ordinal, value) cache table
        # keyed on ONE scalar value per id has no way to represent — a
        # list field would need one row per (id, element), a different
        # shape this plan does not build. `PostgresEra#eligible_for_cache?`
        # is where that boundary lives.

          # that if built any less defensively. Not meant to be
