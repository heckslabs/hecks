      # The PostgresEra side of the boot-time era gate. Where every other
      # adapter's era check can only hold texts and refuse, this one
      # acts: a drifted shape whose translation edge exists, matches by
      # shape label, covers the whole diff, and passes the audit mints
      # the next era — one transaction — and boots into it. Everything
      # else refuses, as loudly and as specifically as the situation
      # allows, naming both authoring tools.
      #
      # Minting happens here, once: era identity (SHA-256 of the canonical
      # storage-shape serialization; the short prefix is the label edges
      # and refusals use) is computed at mint time and stored in
      # hecks_eras. Everything else reads stored names and never hashes
      # anything — an era name is a storage fact, minted on this path or
      # absent, never reconstructed.
      #
      # One concern per file under lineage_manager/: era_resolver (which
      # era is this boot?), minter (the mint path and its refusals),
      # merge_coordinator (bin/merge_tail's driver), coverage_check
      # (what a mint must prove first). What stays here is what they
      # share: the edge chain, and the shadow parse.
