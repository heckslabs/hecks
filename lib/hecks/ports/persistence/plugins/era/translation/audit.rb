    # rules), audit/layer_two.rb (the edge against the reference
    # transform), audit/unfed_report.rb (what nothing feeds), and
    # audit/approval_digest.rb (the human gate's binding). Layer 3 — the
    # before/after sample a human approves, intent not being derivable —
    # is assembled right here in `check`.
