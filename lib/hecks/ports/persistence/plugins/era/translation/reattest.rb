    # the edit change the era's shape, or only its text? Cosmetic edits
    # (comments, whitespace, behavior) re-freeze safely; a shape change
    # would retroactively redefine what era N *meant* for data already
    # written under it, and refuses hard — there is no --accept past
    # this guard.

    # This does not violate minted-once. That prohibition exists so
    # boot-time recognition never depends on canonicalization stability;
    # this is operator-initiated repair, where a false negative is a
    # loud refusal, never a silent misread.
