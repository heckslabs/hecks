      # ── the human gate, made real ──────────────────────────────────
      #
      # For the five portable rule kinds the mint verifies the edge
      # mechanically (Layer 2 is the cross-execution equivalence gate).
      # A compute has no mechanical verification — the Layer-3 sample a
      # human reads is the only one there is — so a compute edge cannot
      # mint until someone has run `bin/translation_audit … --approve`.
      #
      # The approval binds to what was actually reviewed, on both axes:
      # a content digest of the parsed edge (change the edge's meaning
      # and the approval lapses; a comment does not), and the journal's
      # high-water ordinal at review time, recorded in the target
      # database — a token in the repo could not bind to the data, and
      # samples reviewed against staging or against production-as-of-T
      # say nothing about a database that has moved on. Mint stays
      # non-interactive and its lock stays short; the human decision
      # happens in the audit tool, where the samples are.
