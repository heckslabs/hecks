    # The closed, pure half of Postgres's own SQL compiler

    # — the part that turns one TranslationAggregate's declared rules into
    # a jsonb-transforming SQL expression. No database connection, no
    # watermark, no era chain, no catalog lookup: those live in
    # head_compiler.rb's own per-mint assembly, which calls into this
    # module instead of defining these methods itself.
    #
    # A module of its own — not private methods on
    # Adapters::PostgresEra::Lineage — so a second, adapter-agnostic
    # caller (Exporter.translation_aggregate's build-time SQL export,
    # feeding rust/host's own future boot-time mint) can call the exact
    # same code Ruby's own mint path runs, not a hand-ported duplicate
    # that could silently drift the way a hand-kept
    # `Exporter.translation_hash` can drift from `hecks_eras`/
    # `hecks_approvals`' real schema (leaving out rekeys and backfills).
