    # The storage-shape projection of a bluebook: exactly the parts of
    # the IR that decide what persisted data looks like — aggregates,
    # their attributes (with full value-object/entity structure and
    # cardinality), references, the lifecycle field, and the identity
    # paths. Everything behavioral — commands, invariants, queries,
    # policies, lifecycle transitions, defaults, descriptions, comments,
    # the declared routing `version:` — is excluded, so editing behavior
    # never bumps an era and editing shape always does.
    #
    # Three attribute facts on the wire are constraints on persisted
    # values, not behavior, and are still excluded — each decided, not
    # overlooked:
    #
    #   `optional`  — required-ness is enforced at dispatch; stored rows
    #                 are never re-validated on read, so flipping it
    #                 strands nothing already written. Excluded.
    #   `pattern`   — same argument: a fact about what may be written
    #                 next, not about what was stored. Excluded.
    #   `admits`    — the sharpest of the three: narrowing a closed set
    #                 can strand stored rows outside it, and the wire
    #                 carries only the set's name, so a set whose members
    #                 changed under a stable name is invisible even to a
    #                 projection that included the fact (the same lesson
    #                 recursive value-object drift taught). Excluded, and
    #                 named as a gap: constraint tightening has no
    #                 translation-rule vocabulary to acknowledge it yet,
    #                 so including it would mint era bumps nothing can
    #                 explain. When the translation language grows a
    #                 constraint-acknowledgment rule, `admits` (by member
    #                 list, not by name) is first in line, and that
    #                 change bumps FORM_VERSION.
    #
    # Projection runs over the canonical dump form (`to_h`, JSON
    # round-tripped), so a verdict depends only on the IR — never on live
    # object graphs. Structural comparison only, never a hash comparison.
