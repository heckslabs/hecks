    # The boot-time era gate, run for the adapters that HAVE eras — the
    # lineage-capable ones. An era is a fact about stored data that some
    # adapter can carry across a shape change; an adapter that cannot
    # translate has no era to hold, and holding one for it would record
    # history about data nothing can act on.
    #
    # The whole domain is handed to the capable adapter's own era check
    # (Postgres: hold, recognize, mint, or refuse toward the scaffold),
    # which keeps its era facts as rows BESIDE its data. That
    # co-location is load-bearing — a watermark only means something
    # against the journal it was cut from, and an approval recorded
    # anywhere but the reviewed database binds to nothing.
    #
    # The capability is asked of the adapter, never of its name: a
    # second adapter that grows an era story declares lineage_capable?
    # and era_check! and needs no change here.
    #
    # Detection and identity are separate jobs: this check never hashes
    # anything — era names come from the store, already minted (by the
    # scaffold) or absent. Refusal wordings are contract, pinned by the
    # corpus.
