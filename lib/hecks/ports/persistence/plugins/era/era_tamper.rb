    # The refusal wording for a held era whose digest no longer matches its
    # frozen text — the digest mismatch alone is what detects tampering (a
    # plain SHA256 comparison over raw bytes, unrelated to any of this);
    # this only supplies the wording once that's already fired.
    #
    # Lives here, not under `Ports::Persistence` — `project` below directly
    # calls `Runtime::EraGuard.shadow_parse`/`Runtime::StorageShape.project`
    # (DSL-execution machinery), the "an adapter/port reaches into the
    # runtime instead of being handed already-computed data" shape that
    # has caused trouble here before. A capability this dependent on the
    # runtime is a runtime-owned one that the Postgres adapter calls, not
    # a ports-level module that happens to reach sideways into it.
    #
    # Used to also distinguish a cosmetic edit from a real shape change
    # here, by re-parsing the edited text — a pure quality-of-message
    # nicety, not a safety property, since dropped: every tamper refusal
    # reaches the same generic wording now, the one this already fell to
    # whenever it couldn't classify an edit anyway. An operator judges
    # "did this matter" themselves,
    # reading the still-archived original — an anomalous recovery moment
    # already, not a normal boot path.
