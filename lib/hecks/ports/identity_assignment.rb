    # WHICH VALUE A CREATING COMMAND'S OWN IDENTITY FIELD GETS, when
    # neither a slug-from-another-field nor a sequence-with-prefix
    # mechanically answers it — a driving app's own console, say,
    # falls back to this when a collection's identity strategy names
    # "port" rather than "slug"/"sequence" (both of those stay pure
    # config-driven mechanics, computed by whoever is dispatching,
    # never by this port).
    #
    # Pure delegation, same as every sibling port (AccessControl,
    # IdentityGeneration): an app's own domain declares what "port"
    # actually MEANS for it — mint a real UUID via
    # Ports::IdentityGeneration, derive something else entirely — this
    # port just resolves the one adapter that domain wired and calls
    # it, the same "one adapter registry-wide, refuse if zero or many"
    # resolution every other port here already uses.
