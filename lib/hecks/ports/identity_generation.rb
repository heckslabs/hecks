  module Ports
    # A creating command with no natural key needs a value from
    # SOMEWHERE to be its identity — this is that somewhere. Resolved
    # the same way `Ports::Extraction` resolves its own adapter (one
    # adapter registry-wide implements this port, not a per-aggregate
    # binding the way persistence needs — different aggregates have no
    # real reason to want different id-generation strategies within
    # one running app).
    #
    # REPLAY NEEDS NO SUPPRESSION HERE, ON PURPOSE. A UUID minted for a
    # creating command's identity gets baked into that step's own args
    # — an ordinary string value — the moment it's generated, by
    # whoever issues the first, live dispatch. A recorded corpus
    # script or a captured fuzz-replay step already holds that
    # concrete value; replaying it calls `dispatch` with the SAME
    # args, and this module is never consulted again, for the same
    # reason `SecureRandom.uuid` never runs twice for one
    # already-recorded step today. `Event#occurred_at`
    # (`command_rules/emission.rb`) is the one other "environmental
    # fact, not caller-supplied" this codebase has, and it's handled
    # the identical way: it fires on every dispatch, replay included,
    # and comparison simply excludes it.
