module Hecks
  # How a value reads inside a refusal, in one place, because a refusal is an
  # answer and its wording is contract — pinned byte-for-byte by the corpus.
  #
  # `inspect` and JSON agree on scalars and disagree on everything composite :
  # a hash is `{"cents"=>100}` against `{"cents":100}`, an array is `["a", "b"]`
  # against `["a","b"]`. Each such spelling is invisible until a composite
  # actually reaches a message, which is why both known cases were found by
  # something deliberately passing the wrong shape rather than by review — the
  # first by hand in spec/corpus/banking.json, the second by bin/fuzz, at a
  # different site, after the first was patched where it was found.
  #
  # So it lives here rather than in whichever file noticed it, and the house style
  # is JSON because that is what every other refusal in the corpus already prints.

        # — an amount, an id, a lifecycle field) unwraps to its bare
        # scalar, described recursively; a genuinely multi-field value
        # renders as its fields' JSON, same as a bare Hash already does
