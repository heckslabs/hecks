# The forms surface: `expose` (the DSL a `command_form.bluebook`/
# `query_form.bluebook` will eventually become — see docs/
# command-form-and-query-form-bluebook.md), the IR->HTML renderers, and
# the Rack app that content-negotiates between them and a plain JSON
# reading of the same dispatch. NOT required by `require "hecks"`
# itself — a project that never boots this file never pays for `rack`,
# the same lazy-dependency discipline the Gemfile's own comment already
# holds `pg`/`oauth2`/`aws-sdk-lambda` to.
#
# See docs/command-form-and-query-form-bluebook.md for the design this
# implements and what it deliberately leaves for later.

module Hecks
  # Per-chapter `expose` configuration, keyed by chapter name and looked up
  # by the Rack app at request time (`.config`) to decide which chapters'
  # forms are switched on at all — see the file header above for what
  # `expose` deliberately does and does not cover.
  module Forms
    # `expose`'s own declaration — "which chapters does this app expose" —
    # kept OUTSIDE the `Hecks.*` collector convention (`Hecks.bluebook`,
    # `Hecks.hecksagon`, ...) and outside `Runtime::Registry` entirely, on
    # purpose: a real language word goes through `syntax.bluebook` and
    # `MetaValidator` (see docs/implemented/guides/extending-hecks.md, "a new word is a
    # declared row before it is a line of Ruby") and is judged by
    # spec/syntax_conformance_spec.rb + spec/dsl_coverage_spec.rb — gates
    # this construct has not earned yet. An ordinary Ruby DSL, one level of
    # module state, no different in kind from a project's own initializer —
    # see docs/command-form-and-query-form-bluebook.md, "why this isn't
    # syntax.bluebook yet".
    #
    # ONE `expose` GRANTS A WHOLE CHAPTER, not a command or a query
    # individually — the future `command_form.bluebook`/`query_form.bluebook`
    # words are PER-DECLARATION (one command, one query, its own form/view,
    # possibly its own overrides), which `expose` doesn't do today and was
    # never trying to; it's the coarse "turn this chapter's forms on at
    # all" switch those finer words will eventually sit inside.
