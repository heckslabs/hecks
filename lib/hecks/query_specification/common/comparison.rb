      # THE ONE COMPARATOR TABLE. There were two, near-identical copies of
      # this — `Ports::Query::InMemory` (the path a Memory- or Heki-backed
      # aggregate query actually runs) and `Runtime::QueryInterpreter`
      # (entity/sub-list queries, and any adapter implementing no `:query`)
      # — plus a third partial reading of `comparable` inside
      # `SqlQueryBuilder#query_value`.
      #
      # Two copies of one rule is not a style complaint here; it has cost
      # real bugs twice already, both recorded in the comments those files
      # carried. `none_in_state` was added to one copy only, so an ordinary
      # Memory query's `none_in_state` clause fell to the `else` branch and
      # silently excluded every row. And `comparable` DIVERGED without
      # anyone noticing: one copy took the FIRST numeric member of a value
      # object, the other only unwrapped when there was EXACTLY ONE — so a
      # value object with two numeric members compared as a number on one
      # path and as a whole Hash on the other.
      #
      # The callers still differ in how they REACH a value — one takes a
      # registry argument, the other closes over `@registry`; one digs the
      # field through `FieldPath`, the other is handed it — so they keep
      # their own resolution and share only the comparison itself.
