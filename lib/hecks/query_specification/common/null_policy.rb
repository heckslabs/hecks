        # STABLE on purpose : rows arrive already in identity order from
        # Ports::Query::Ordering, and that base is what makes a tie deterministic
        # rather than store-dependent. A plain sort_by is not stable in Ruby, so
        # equal keys would shuffle and the identity tier would be lost exactly
        # where it is needed. Descending reverses both partitions, so a tie reads
        # identity-descending too — the same total order sql_order renders as
        # `field DESC, id DESC`.

        # default to decide: Postgres puts nulls LAST on ASC (and FIRST
        # on DESC), while `#order` above — this same "native" default,
        # for Memory — puts nulls FIRST on ASC (and LAST on DESC), the
        # SQLite convention. Same query, same data, different row order
        # depending only on which adapter ran it. Rendered explicitly
        # here instead, so an undeclared policy means the SAME total
        # order everywhere rather than "whatever this store already does"
        # — matching `#order`'s own default rather than the other way
        # round, since that default is unconditional (Memory/Heki have no
        # dialect to defer to) and SQLite already agrees with it natively.

        # THE COMPARATORS A NULL CANNOT SATISFY — the other half of
        # `sql_predicate` below. That one answers "the value COMPARED TO is
        # null" (`eq: nil` -> IS NULL, `ne: nil` -> IS NOT NULL, a real
        # convention both adapters already shared). This one answers the
        # case nothing covered: the ROW'S OWN value is null and the value
        # compared to is not.
        #
        # SQL says unknown. `NULL <> 'red'` is NULL, not true, so the row
        # is not returned. Ruby says `nil != "red"` is true, so it is. The
        # two adapters therefore answered the SAME query on the SAME data
        # differently — Memory returning a row SQLite omitted — which is
        # not a difference of opinion a caller can plan around.
        #
        # Resolved toward SQL, and not because SQL is the store: an absent
        # or null field is UNKNOWN, not a value, and a comparison against
        # unknown is unknown rather than true. Making SQL match Ruby
        # instead would mean compiling every `ne:` to
        # `(col <> $1 OR col IS NULL)` — more to get right in two
        # dialects, and a reliable way to lose an index — to make a real
        # query engine agree with an in-memory one.
        #
        # `none_in_state` is deliberately NOT here: it is a 9th, vendored
        # comparator whose `held` is a reference id, and a row holding no
        # reference is genuinely "not in that state" rather than unknown.
