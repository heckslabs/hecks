# Hecks::Behaviors::Expectations
#
# One test case, start to finish: take the suite's own runtime (booted
# once for exactly what its `loads` names, reset to nothing between
# tests — `runtime_for`), replay `setup` dispatches, dispatch (or query)
# the command under test, check `expect`. Split out of
# runner.rb the same way the file-count/sweep concern is split from a
# single test's own execution.
#
# TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS from a prior port of this same idea (read
# before writing this, not reinvented):
#
# 1. A `setup` refusal and a refusal from the command under test are
#    caught in SEPARATE rescue scopes. The prior port wrapped the whole
#    test body — setups included — in one `rescue *REFUSAL_CLASSES`, so a
#    broken setup could spuriously satisfy `expect refused: "..."` if its
#    own refusal happened to match the expected substring. Here, any
#    domain refusal during `setup` is unconditionally an ERROR — the
#    example never got to the situation it claims to test.
#
# 2. `emits:` is read off a `registry.event_log` DIFF around the tested
#    dispatch, not off `Result#events` alone. `Result#events` only holds
#    the events the OUTERMOST dispatch announced; a policy's own cascade
#    reenters through the same `Dispatcher#dispatch` (`PolicyInterpreter
#    #deliver` → `door.reenter` → `dispatch`), and every dispatch's
#    events — outer and reentrant alike — land in the one shared
#    `registry.event_log`, in order (`CommandRules::Emission#emit`,
#    `PortOperationInterpreter#emit`/`#call`). Diffing that log's length
#    before/after the tested dispatch is the one read that actually sees
#    a cascade — this DSL has no `kind: :cascade` because cascades are
#    always on and `emits:` is expected to see them.
