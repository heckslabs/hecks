# Hecks::Behaviors::{TestSetup,TestCase,BehaviorsSuite}
#
# The `.behaviors` authoring surface's own IR — plain Structs, holding
# exactly what `Hecks.behaviors "Name" do ... end` collected. Deliberately
# not part of `Hecks::IR`/`emits_ir` — a behaviors suite is never
# collected into a domain Registry (see `Hecks.behaviors`), never
# dispatched through MetaValidator, and carries none of the self-hosted
# round-trip machinery a real bluebook construct does. It is a test
# artifact a runner reads on demand, not a domain a boot needs.
