    # A value that is DELIBERATELY THE WRONG SHAPE for the attribute it is handed
    # to — the sibling of ValueGenerator, which only ever builds values that satisfy
    # a declared type.
    #
    # That limit is why the fuzzer could not reach the space a hand-written
    # adversarial corpus covers. spec/corpus/banking.json got there one step at a
    # time, by hand : a value object where an Integer is declared, a Float where an
    # Integer is declared, a numeral wearing quotes, an attribute missing entirely,
    # an attribute the command never declared. One of those — a hash reaching a
    # refusal message — is the exact shape that exposed refusal wording drift
    # (a composite rendered with `inspect` at one site and JSON at another —
    # Rendering's whole story), and no generated value
    # could ever have produced it.
    #
    # These are expected to be REFUSED, and that is the point : a refusal is an
    # answer, and its wording is pinned byte-for-byte. The bugs live in
    # the sentence, not in the happy path.
