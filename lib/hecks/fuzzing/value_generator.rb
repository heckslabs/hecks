    # One attribute, one value — in the exact JSON shape the hand-written
    # corpus already uses (a value-object-typed attribute is a nested hash keyed
    # by its own field names ; a reference is the BARE ID of the head it points
    # at, because that is what a reference is). Everything
    # returned is a plain, JSON-safe Ruby value : String keys throughout, never
    # symbols, so a generated step can be dumped straight to JSON.
    #
    # Biased toward the edge cases a hand-written corpus tends to under-sample —
    # empty strings, quotes, commas, unicode, zero, negative numbers — because
    # `marks.rb` names literal-encoding loss "the largest family of bug in this
    # codebase," and a fixed corpus of a few dozen examples rarely happens to
    # exercise the boundary that actually breaks. But mostly not : an attribute
    # named `email`/`currency` almost always needs a specific shape just to get
    # PAST its own invariant (`address.include?("@")`, `currency.size == 3`) —
    # banking's very first fuzz run never got past Customer.Register, because
    # no plain random word ever contains "@". Reaching deep state matters more
    # than edge-casing every single field every single time, so the "normal"
    # path is now name-aware for the couple of shapes that are genuinely
    # common across domains, and edge cases stay real but less frequent.
