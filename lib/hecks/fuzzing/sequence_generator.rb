    # A random-but-valid sequence of dispatches and queries, in the exact
    # `{name, note, steps}` shape `spec/corpus/*.json` already uses — so a
    # generated sequence replays as a corpus member, completely unchanged.
    # Boots a throwaway copy of
    # the domain and DISPATCHES each candidate step for real as it builds the
    # sequence (not just synthesizing plausible-looking JSON) : the only way to
    # know whether a step actually reached a new state, or which id an
    # auto-minted entity landed on, is to run it and watch what happened.
    #
    # Single-call fuzzing mostly misses the bugs this project has actually
    # found — they needed STATE first (a saga leg acting on a transfer that
    # already exists, a reference pointing at a customer already registered).
    # So this tracks what it has created as it goes, the same way
    # spec/banking_state_machine_spec.rb's hand-written generator does, and
    # weights later steps toward acting on what already exists.
    #
    # One concern per file beside this one: what the domain offers
    # (sequence_generator/catalog.rb), which step to try next (picker.rb),
    # how a step is built and dispatched (step_builder.rb), and what a
    # success taught us (outcome_tracker.rb).

      # This is NOT a malformation and must not be filed as one. `malform`
      # drops an argument too, but a dropped REQUIRED argument is refused,
      # a refusal writes no record, and bin/fuzz counts it SILENT — so the
      # one outcome worth reaching (a stored record carrying a null, then
      # QUERIED) was unreachable from that path by construction. Until
      # this existed no generated history contained a null at all, which
      # meant `query_answers_match_reference` — the differential that
      # diffs every native adapter against the reference interpreter — had
      # never once compared a nullable field. Four query bugs shipped in
      # exactly that blind spot (`ne:` with an empty string, array `in:`,
