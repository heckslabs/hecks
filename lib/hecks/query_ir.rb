    # own "(declared)" owner here even AFTER `SafeDepositBox`/
    # `OnboardingCase` were converted to bare chapter-wide references,
    # because a REFERENCED given still write-throughs into its own
    # aggregate's `@named_givens` — the SAME reason `collect_rules`'
    # own top comment already gives for why object identity carries no
    # signal past a bluebook's own build: the EXPORTED IR cannot tell
    # "I declared this myself" apart from "I referenced someone else's
    # declaration," because by the time anything reads `chapter.
    # aggregates`, both look identical. Closing this would mean reading
    # SOURCE TEXT (bare `given(desc)` vs. block `given(desc) { ... }`),
    # not the built IR this query is deliberately built on — a
    # different, source-level tool, not a fix to this one. Treat a
    # still-flagged group naming multiple aggregates as "verify by
    # hand whether this is ALREADY a chapter-wide reference before
    # assuming it's fresh duplication," not as an automatic signal
    # either way.
    #
    # THE IDENTICAL GAP, ONE LEVEL DOWN: chapter-wide ENTITY-scoped
    # sharing (`EntityBuilder#given`'s own bare form,
    # `docs/implemented/resolution-rules/chapter-entity-given.md`) hits this same wall for
    # the same structural reason — `SafeDepositBox.Visit` still shows
    # as its own "(declared)" owner here even after becoming a bare
    # reference to `Account.LedgerEntry`'s declaration, because a piece
    # resolving a chapter-wide reference still write-throughs the
    # resolved `Given` into its own `@named_givens` (so ITS OWN
    # commands can read it back locally without a second hop). This is
    # not a NEW limitation this feature introduces — it is the exact
    # same IR-cannot-distinguish-declared-from-referenced fact, one
    # scope wider. `bin/query_ir duplicates` confirms this directly:
    # `Account.LedgerEntry (declared)` and `SafeDepositBox.Visit
    # (declared)` both appear under the same `given: "customer is
    # active"` group — verify by hand, same as the aggregate-level
    # case above, before assuming a group naming two pieces under
    # different aggregates is fresh duplication rather than an already-
