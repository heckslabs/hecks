# Hecks::Bluebook
#
# Everything a .bluebook file becomes on its way to running: the expression
# language (expression/), the model itself (the chapter class plus
# everything it declares), the assembly that turns
# declarations back into that graph (assembly.rb + assembly/), the authoring
# DSL (dsl/), and the meta-validator that judges a chapter against the
# language's own grammar (meta_validator.rb + meta_validator/).
#
# The require order below preserves the boot order the flat list in
# lib/hecks.rb used to spell: expression and IR first (pure
# declarations), assembly's collaborators before its face, the DSL before
# the meta-validator that its builders call at build time.

module Hecks
  # Declared as a class, not a module — `Hecks::Bluebook` is a
  # chapter (bluebook/chapter.rb carries its body). Everything a chapter
  # declares nests under it, as do the ways to build one (`DSL`) and to
  # judge one (`MetaValidator`). Reopening this anywhere must say `class`.
  module Bluebook
  end
end

# What the chapter's own files lean on at class-body level (`extend
# Construct`, the assembly's QuerySpecification marks) — required here
# because those files' contents are frozen and cannot say so themselves.
