    # A PROJECTION RATHER THAN A BIN/ SCRIPT, and that correction is the
    # point of it. This was first written as its own program with its own
    # call shape, beside `bin/project_parser_table`, `bin/reference` and
    # `bin/expression_projection` — four tools doing "canonical IR in,
    # external artifact out" four different ways, which is the exact
    # thing the projector registry exists to stop.
    #
    # Reads the chapter's JUDGED IR, so what is written out is what the
    # language actually holds rather than what a builder happened to
    # produce.
