    # A DOMAIN'S OWN SHAPE, PROJECTED AS MERMAID DIAGRAMS — the same
    # trick `Projections::Reference`/`DocsProjector` already play for
    # prose, one level further: a diagram generated FROM the
    # declaration can't drift from it the way a hand-drawn one
    # inevitably does, because there is no second copy to forget to
    # update.
    #
    # MERMAID, NOT GRAPHVIZ (the two considered) — every diagram type
    # below has a Mermaid form purpose-built for exactly what the
    # underlying construct already is (a `lifecycle` IS a state
    # machine, `has_many`/`belongs_to` already speaks in cardinality,
    # `emits`/`trigger` already IS a directed graph), and the output is
    # plain text that renders natively wherever this project's own docs
    # already live — GitHub markdown, this repo's generated docs, Claude
    # Artifacts — with no build step and no external binary. Graphviz's
    # DOT format needs an actual render step (a `dot` binary, or a WASM
    # port) to become anything viewable, which is a real dependency this
    # repository's own discipline (see rust/parser's Cargo.toml: "no
    # dependency earns its way past std") would rather not take just to
    # draw a diagram.

    # FOUR DIAGRAM KINDS, one file each per domain except lifecycles

    #
    # CONSTRUCT NAMES (aggregate/entity/command/event) ARE USED BARE,
    # UNSANITIZED, as Mermaid node/entity ids — safe because this
    # language's own word grammar only ever admits simple CamelCase/
    # snake_case identifiers there (confirmed: no space or punctuation
    # appears in any real aggregate/command/event name across the corpus
    # this projects from). A `role:` STRING IS FREE TEXT, though — the
    # real corpus already has "Back office"/"Vault officer"/"Branch
    # clerk" — so `roles.mmd` is the one diagram here that sanitizes a
    # name into an id (`role_id`) while keeping the real string as the
    # node's own displayed label.

      # "WHAT CAN I DO TO THIS, WHAT CAN I ASK ABOUT IT" — one file per
      # holder, unlike every other diagram here: `dispatch.mmd` already
      # shows a command's own onward reaction chain, but never an
      # aggregate's own FULL command/query menu in one place, and
      # `roles.mmd` shows who issues a command without saying what else
      # that same aggregate answers. This is the one diagram meant to
      # be read starting from the aggregate, not from a verb or a fact.
      #
      # A QUERY IS A DIAMOND — a fifth shape, beside `dispatch.mmd`'s
      # stadium/hexagon, `ports.mmd`'s trapezoid, and `read_models.mmd`'s
      # subroutine: a question with an answer, not a verb that changes
      # anything. Command edges are solid ("does"); query edges are
      # dotted ("asks") — the same solid/dotted split `ports.mmd`
      # already uses for "routes to:" versus "exposes".
      #
      # A WRITE TARGET IS A PLAIN RECTANGLE — a sixth shape, the first
      # here with no special bracket at all: an attribute is the
      # smallest, most passive thing this vocabulary names, a single
      # field living INSIDE the cylinder rather than a bounded thing of
      # its own. `command.mutations` (`sets`/`increment`/`decrement`/
      # `append`) was invisible everywhere before this — not just in a
      # diagram, in ANY projection, including the prose ones — despite
      # being the single densest fact in the whole IR (53 real
      # mutations across pizzas + banking). `dispatch.mmd` draws what a
      # command EMITS; this draws what it WRITES, the other half of
      # "what actually happens" a command never showed before.
      #
      # THE SAME ATTRIBUTE NODE MERGES ACROSS COMMANDS — real in
      # banking: `Account.Credit` and `Account.Debit` both point at the
      # same `balance` node, the same "one node, several incoming
      # edges" merge `read_models.mmd` already does for an aggregate
      # fed by several read_models.
      #
      # THE LABEL NAMES THE REAL SOURCE, NOT JUST THE VERB — an
      # increment/decrement/set almost always takes its value from an
      # argument, but not always the SAME-NAMED one: real in banking,
      # `Account.Credit`'s own `balance` is incremented by its
      # `amount` argument, and `LedgerEntry.Amend`'s own `amount` is
      # incremented by its `adjustment` argument. A literal source
      # (pizzas' own `Order.Purchase` sets `status` to the literal
      # `"sold"`, not an argument at all) is named as verbatim as
      # every other fact in this file. `append`'s own fields carry no
      # single source at all — its own field NAMES are the fact worth
      # stating (real: `Order.AddTopping` appends `name, amount`).

      # ── sagas -> stateDiagram-v2 ─────────────────────────────────────

      # A SAGA HAS A LIFECYCLE TOO — the same `stateDiagram-v2` shape
      # `lifecycle_diagram` already draws, one file per process_manager
      # the same way lifecycle is one file per lifecycle-bearing holder.
      # What's different is the label: a lifecycle's own edge is labeled
      # by the COMMAND that causes it (an aggregate transitions because
      # something was DONE to it); a saga's edge is labeled by the EVENT
      # that causes it (a saga advances because something HAPPENED,
      # possibly nowhere near the saga itself) — the same command/event
      # split `dispatch.mmd`'s own stadium/hexagon vocabulary already
      # draws, here spent on which noun labels a stateDiagram-v2 edge
      # instead.
      #
      # THE LABEL ALSO NAMES WHAT THE TRANSITION DISPATCHES — a fact no
      # existing diagram states for a saga at all: a lifecycle's own
      # edge only ever names the one command that caused it; a saga's
      # edge can fire several commands at once (real in banking:
      # Settlement's own AccountDebited handler dispatches both
      # Transfer.Debited and Account.Credit). Confirmed real in the
      # corpus: no saga dispatch ever declares a `to:`/`target_domain`
      # of its own (unlike a policy's `across`) — every command a saga
      # fires lands inside its own bluebook chapter, so this never needs
      # `dispatch.mmd`'s own "triggers in X" cross-domain label.
      #
      # THE COMPENSATING LEG READS LIKE ANY OTHER — its own trigger is
      # the literal string "refused" (`ProcessManager::REFUSED`, this
      # language's own Trigger vocabulary), not invented text: a
      # dispatch declined is exactly as real a cause of a state
      # transition as an event announced, and the diagram states it
      # exactly as verbatim as every other edge here does.

      # ── frameworks -> flowchart ─────────────────────────────────────

      # EVERY OTHER DIAGRAM IN THIS FILE STAYS INSIDE ONE DOMAIN'S OWN
      # BOUNDARY — this is the one that steps outside it. A real domain
      # depends on another domain's own aggregates in exactly two ways:
      # `uses_framework "X"` in its `.hecksagon` (`Hecksagon#framework_
      # members`), which loads X's whole bluebook into THIS registry,
      # unconditionally, the moment this domain boots; or a policy's own
      # `across "X"` (`Policy#target_domain`), which only reaches X when
      # the policy's declared event actually fires. Same underlying
      # fact `dispatch.mmd`'s own `trigger_edge` already draws from the
      # command's side ("triggers in X") — this draws it again from the
      # DOMAIN's side, next to the structural `uses_framework` fact
      # `dispatch.mmd` never sees at all (that lives in the `.hecksagon`,
      # which no other diagram here is handed).
      #
      # NEITHER THIS DOMAIN NOR EACH DEPENDENCY GETS THE holders() TREATMENT
      # — a whole domain is drawn as ONE cylinder, the same "a bounded,
      # addressable thing" shape every other diagram here already spends
      # on a single aggregate, just scaled up one level: a domain is a
      # bigger box the same kind of box lives inside.
      #
      # DOTTED FOR `attaches`, SOLID FOR `reaches across` — the reverse
      # of which fact is "always true" between the two: attaching a
      # framework is a standing declaration, true every time this domain
      # boots, so it gets the same dotted "this always belongs" treatment
      # `ports.mmd` gives an aggregate's own `-.->|exposes|` edge.
      # Reaching across only happens when a real policy actually fires —
      # the same solid edge `dispatch.mmd`'s own `trigger_edge` already
      # draws for the identical fact, kept solid here so the same
      # relationship reads the same way in both diagrams.
      #
      # `options[:hecksagon]` IS THE ONE DIAGRAM IN THIS FILE THAT NEEDS
      # MORE THAN `bluebook` — `framework_members` lives on the
      # `Hecksagon`, a sibling IR object `bin/project_diagrams` already
      # has in hand (`registry.hecksagon(chapter_name)`) but `bluebook`
      # itself carries no reference to. No hecksagon handed in (an older
      # caller, or a spec that doesn't care) just means no frameworks.mmd
