      # HOW THE MODEL'S SHAPE DIFFERS FROM THE LANGUAGE'S, and why.
      #
      # Every construct's `emits_ir` restates what the grammar declares —
      # and the two legitimately differ, in seven ways. These lived only
      # as prose in Ruby comments until spec/model_shape_conformance_spec
      # made them checkable; they live HERE so the generator and the gate
      # read one source rather than two that must agree.
      #
      # A reason is carried beside each entry because the generated file
      # will CARRY it: a deviation is exactly the kind of thing whose
      # explanation must survive regeneration, and the only way it can is
      # to be emitted rather than typed into the output.

        # The grammar is relational — a Command points UP at its
        # Aggregate — where the model composes. An explicit `as:` still
        # keeps its `_id` (Command's own `entity_id`, kept as data); the
        # parent link itself mints bare now (ADR 0025) — `aggregate` or
        # `bluebook`, whichever this category's creating command declares
