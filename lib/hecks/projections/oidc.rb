  module Projections
    # An OIDC client/scope manifest derived from a domain's own IR: what
    # an identity provider has to know about this domain before it can
    # issue a token that means anything here.
    #
    # **The artifact half of something already half-built**.
    # `spec/oidc_projection_spec.rb` covers the integration half — verified
    # claims in, `IdentityResolution.resolve` → `Authorization.holds_role?`
    # → a dispatch scoped by `Hecks.as_caller(role:)`. That half enforces
    # a role per command. It just had no way to say, up front and as data,
    # which role each command wants — every answer came from asking the
    # live runtime one dispatch at a time.
    #
    # This is that catalogue, and the two are checked against each other
    # rather than merely coexisting: `verb` here is spelled exactly as
    # `Runtime::Dispatcher#dispatch` takes it and exactly as
    # `Bluebook#verbs` lists it, so a scope can never name a command
    # the domain does not have (spec/projections/oidc_projection_spec.rb
    # holds the two lists equal), and `role` is the same string
    # `Ports::Authorization.holds_role?` compares against a real
    # `Governance::RoleAssignment`.
    #
    # **Roles come from the commands, not from governance**. A command's own
    # `role "Compliance officer"` is in the bluebook IR
    # (`Command#role`), whereas `uses_framework "Governance"` is
    # declared in the `.hecksagon` — which `call(bluebook:, options:)`
    # cannot see at all. Reading the commands is both the only thing
    # available here and the more accurate source: it says what each
    # command actually demands, not merely which role vocabulary the
    # application happened to mount.
    #
    # A command with no declared role projects `"role" => nil` rather
    # than being dropped — an unguarded command is a real fact about the
    # domain, and silently omitting it would make the manifest read as
    # though the command did not exist.
