    # The DSL reference pages, projected from the chapter's own Syntax
    # aggregate — the tables come from the declaration, the prose is
    # preserved from whatever is already committed.
    #
    # The first projection that emits a tree. `emits: :files` says so,
    # and the framework writes the map rather than inferring one: a Hash
    # of path => contents and a Hash that merely holds strings are the
    # same object to Ruby, so only the projection can know which it
    # meant. This is the case the output contract was designed for and
    # deliberately left unimplemented until something real needed it.
    #
    # Not pure, and it cannot be. `Doc::Reference.pages` reads the
    # committed pages to harvest their prose, so the existing directory
    # is an input — passed as `from:` rather than assumed, so the
    # projection never reaches for a path of its own choosing.
