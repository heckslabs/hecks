module Hecks
  # SHARED MACHINERY for a codemod that migrates real `.bluebook` source
  # once a DSL builder change makes some previously-required declaration
  # optional/redundant — pulled out of `bin/codemod_implicit_append_fields`
  # (the first one built), which needed three real, hard-won fixes before
  # it could be trusted: a process-lifetime AST cache with no
  # invalidation, a batch-revert granularity that let one unsafe
  # candidate sink every other safe one sharing its boot, and (in the
  # SPINE the codemod migrates FOR, not here) an append-at-end insertion
  # that only round-tripped correctly for whichever field happened to be
  # last. None of those are guessable in advance; they only surface by
  # actually running a real edit against real self-hosted code. This
  # module is that lesson, kept — the NEXT codemod plugs in two rule-
  # specific procs (`find_candidates`, `apply_candidate`) and inherits
  # the boot/safety-net machinery rather than rediscovering it.
  #
  # A CODEMOD IS NOT PATTERN-MATCHING ALONE. Deciding "is this line safe
  # to delete" means knowing what the RUNTIME would resolve it to — so
  # every codemod built on this module follows the same three steps:
  #   1. Boot the real domain (or the self-hosted meta-domain) and read
  #      its IR to find CANDIDATES — provided by the caller's own
  #      `find_candidates`, since the actual redundancy rule is specific
  #      to whichever spine change this migration serves.
  #   2. Locate and remove each candidate's own source text — the
  #      caller's own `apply_candidate`.
  #   3. Re-boot from the edited text and diff the full IR export
  #      against the pre-edit export. Byte-identical -> keep. Anything
  #      else (including a RAISED exception — the self-hosted
  #      meta-domain DISPATCHES itself into being, S14, so a bad edit
  #      can surface as a runtime refusal, not just a differing export)
  #      -> revert and report SKIPPED, never silently guessed past.
  #
  # DESIGN-TIME CHECKLIST for the SPINE change a future codemod migrates
  # corpus text for — both items below are real bugs THIS module's own
  # first use found, not hypothetical:
  #   - Does the resolved value get inserted into an ORDER-SENSITIVE
  #     list (the exported IR is array-order-sensitive throughout)? If
  #     so, the spine's own insertion must preserve the ORIGINAL
  #     position, not just append — an append-at-end insertion only
  #     round-trips correctly for a value that already happened to be
  #     last.
  #   - Does resolution depend on ANOTHER construct already being
  #     declared (the aggregate/entity a `sets`/`append:` field resolves
  #     against)? If a creator command can be declared BEFORE the
  #     construct it creates (real, live: `command "Handler"` before
  #     `entity "Handler"`, one file down), one-pass resolution
  #     genuinely cannot see it yet — not a codemod bug, a structural
  #     limit worth naming rather than working around.
