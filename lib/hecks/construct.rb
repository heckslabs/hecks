module Hecks
  # The invisible field a built construct carries.
  #
  # ## Identity
  #
  # A construct is a record with an owner chain — the chapter (Bluebook)
  # owns its aggregates, an aggregate owns everything declared on it — and the
  # bluebook identity is carried in its own field, under a `hecks_` prefix that
  # no domain attribute can collide with. Invisible means exactly that: not an
  # attribute, not a key in `to_h`, not a reader on instances. Framework
  # metadata about the construct, not part of the domain it describes.
  #
  # The identity is computed by walking owners rather than stamped, so nothing
  # has to be re-stamped when a chapter is assembled after its aggregates:
  #
  #     Pizzas                     the chapter — no owner
  #     Pizzas::Pizza              an aggregate joins its chapter with ::
  #     Pizzas::Pizza.Price        everything else joins its owner with .
  #
  # That spelling is not invented here. It is the id `MetaValidator::Judge`
  # already mints in `#identify`, so a construct and the meta-domain's
  # record of that construct carry the same identity, and there is no
  # translation table between them to be quietly wrong in.
  #
  # ## Usage
  #
  #     price = Class.new(ValueObject)   # a declaration holder
  #     price.hecks_name  = "Price"
  #     price.hecks_owner = pizza_ir         # the Aggregate that declares it
  #     price.hecks_fqn                      # => "Pizzas::Pizza.Price"
  module Construct
    # A construct asked for an identity it cannot compute.

    # What declares this one — the chapter above an aggregate, the aggregate
    # above a value object. nil for a chapter, which is the top.
    attr_accessor :hecks_owner

    attr_writer :hecks_name

    # A chapter is the only construct that legitimately has no owner. Everything
    # else is declared in something, so a missing owner is an unstamped construct
    # rather than a top — see hecks_fqn.
    attr_writer :hecks_root

    # Whether this construct is the top of its own owner chain.

    # How this construct joins its owner. An aggregate is a member of its
    # chapter's namespace (`::`) ; everything else is declared on its owner
    # (`.`). Overridden by Aggregate, defaulted here for every other construct.
    #
    # @return [String] `"."`, the separator this construct uses in `hecks_fqn`
    def hecks_separator = "."

    # Refuses rather than guesses. A construct with no owner and no claim to be a
    # chapter has simply not been stamped yet — entity commands are in that state
    # while entities are still IR objects — and answering the bare name would be a
    # plausible half-truth that no test would notice. That shape of falsehood is
    # what this repo keeps finding, so it goes red instead.
    #
    # @return [String] the fully-qualified name, joining every owner from the
    #   chapter down to this construct
