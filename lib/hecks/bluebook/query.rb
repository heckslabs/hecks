    # A query — an ASK, declared on an aggregate or on one of its entities.
    #
    # It crosses over as an INSTANCE rather than a class, and the reason is worth
    # stating because it is the boundary of the pattern. A query inherits its
    # whole body from `QuerySpecification::Common::Options` — `wheres`,
    # `order_by`, `limit`, `offset`, `cursor`,
    # `authorization`, `null_semantics`, `inspection` — and those
    # are INSTANCE methods that the runtime and the SQLite adapter both read.
    # Hoisting the declaration onto a metaclass would put the identity and the
    # specification on opposite sides of the object.
    #
    # And nothing is lost, because `Class#name` was the only reason a construct
    # ever needed a second word for its own name. An instance answers `name`
    # truthfully. So a query gains an owner and an identity — which is what the
    # graph is for — and keeps the name it always had.
