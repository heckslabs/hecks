        # its OWN identity field's name, not a synthetic foreign key, and
        # every such dispatch refused. That question is not this policy's
        # to answer at all — it depends on the TARGET COMMAND'S OWN
        # declared shape, not on the aggregate name alone — so it now

        # resolved target command by `PolicyInterpreter#addressing_key_for`.
