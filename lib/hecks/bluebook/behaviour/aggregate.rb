      # What an aggregate does, as opposed to what it holds.
      #
      # The holding half — the field list, the readers, the emission — is
      # the same list the language already declares in
      # `language/bluebook/aggregate.bluebook`, said a second and third
      # time in Ruby. This half is not: derived identity, the name
      # indexes, the owner stamping and the finders are decisions about
      # how the declared shape is used, and no grammar states them.
      #
      # Split so the holding half can be generated from the language
      # without any of this being in the blast radius of a regeneration.
      # Everything here is hand-written and permanent.
      #
      # The three traits are shared with Entity (and, for `Indexed`,
      # with Command and PortOperation) — see behaviour/traits.rb on why
      # they are one module rather than four copies.
