        # MEANS), the ports table — which a `.hecksagon` fills later, so
        # the bluebook cannot declare it — and stamping its own children,
        # the same act an Aggregate performs one level down.

        # `policy` block in this chapter's own `.bluebook`) and attaches it
        # here, after the chapter already exists, the same reasoning
        # `add_port` gives one method up. Kept out of the bluebook itself
        # on purpose: which FOREIGN domain's event this chapter reacts to

        # (a command_name with a "." in it), so a verb this method left
        # out was never "not a verb," only one this list forgot to name.

        # already proved out for the meta-domain's own grammar (S17, ADR
        # 0026) — entities nest arbitrarily deep (`Dispatch`, inside
        # `Handler`), so one flat level isn't enough.
