        # unrelated one. Real, corpus-caught bug: a hecksagon binding two
        # aggregates to two different adapters under the same verb (one to
        # Heki, one to Memory) sent Memory's lookup down Heki's generic
        # entry, then failed `check_settings` with "Memory does not
        # declare :dir" — the generic entry's own `settings[:adapter]`
        # names Heki, not Memory, so the fallback was never actually for
        # this bind. `{}` is exactly right when nothing was configured for
        # this adapter — Memory, which takes no values at all.
