    # Judges a bluebook by DISPATCHING it into the language declared in itself.
    #
    # `lib/hecks/language/bluebook/` declares what a bluebook IS —
    # Chapter, Root, Verb, Shape, Ask, Piece, and the rest, split across files
    # by domain concept and merged into one chapter at load time (see
    # GRAMMAR_FILES below). This replays a built IR into that domain and turns
    # any refusal into a Malformed, so the meta-domain is what actually judges
    # rather than a description sitting beside the code — for whatever rules
    # it carries. `spec/meta_rules_spec.rb`'s own header names the plan: port
    # the language's rules OUT of builder `raise Malformed` calls and INTO
    # `given`/`invariant` here, where they are declarations any reader of the
    # meta-domain can consume instead of behavior buried in a builder.
    #
    # THIS MIGRATION IS PARTIAL, NOT DONE. As of this writing the meta-domain
    # declares 62 given/invariant/ensures rules (`Hecks::QueryIR.collect_rules`
    # against `grammar_registry.bluebook("Bluebook")` enumerates them) —
    # `spec/meta_rule_reachability_spec.rb` is what proves, per declaration,
    # not per verb, that most of them still lack a spec exercising the
    # refusal at all (see that file's own KNOWN_GAPS for the current count).
    # Meanwhile `lib/hecks/bluebook/dsl/` still carries well over a hundred
    # `raise Malformed` calls of its own — some are genuinely pre-IR
    # construction errors (arity, argument shape) that cannot become
    # meta-domain rules, and some are exactly the semantic kind this file
    # claims to have moved (see `aggregate_builder.rb`'s `seal_*` passes:
    # a mutation into a field the aggregate never declares, a lifecycle guard
    # on an aggregate with no lifecycle). No doc currently inventories which
    # is which, or tracks migrating the latter — that inventory is the actual
    # next step, not a "delete the folder" thought experiment.
    #
    # So: "delete language/bluebook/ and validation stops" is true for the 62
    # rules actually declared here, and false for whatever a builder's own
    # `raise Malformed` still checks — the language does not yet own its own
    # enforcement end to end, and this comment used to claim it already did.
    # The self-hosting mechanism itself is real and is the point worth
    # keeping : a self-description that only describes is indistinguishable
    # from enforcement, and the first version of this file was deleted for
    # exactly that reason. What is not yet real is that self-hosting being
    # the WHOLE of validation.

      # It stayed unlanded for one wrong belief, worth naming because it looked so

      # `ReadModel#to_h` omitted a read model's filters until 2026-08-11, so
      # read-model filtering seemed impossible to read back —
      # and hoisted policies lost which head declared them for the same reason.
      # But `to_h` is a PROJECTION and the language is the
      # SOURCE. They must agree about everything to_h spells ; they need not be the
      # same size. Both were held even before the wire format carried them, as
      # declarations the wire format didn't yet see.
      #
      # UPDATE, 2026-08-11: the wire format DID move, on purpose, for a reason
      # unrelated to this file — a Rust-codegen task needed `wheres`/
      # `order_by`/`limit` on the wire to compile a read model's real declared
      # filtering, and the boundary described above was never load-bearing for
      # THIS mechanism (`option_rows`/`filter_options` in meta_validator/
      # readings.rb read `node.wheres`/`node.order_by`/`node.limit` off the

      # entire window, and the window is not narrow — every word routed
      # through `word_gate_dispatch` while the language judged itself
      # re-ran the ~284-dispatch syntax boot (42 times, 32 seconds, per
      # process — see SyntaxBoot.call's own comment). It keys its cache
      # on the registry's chapter set instead, which is the actual input
      # the snapshot is a function of. Kept here for any other derived

      # fresh store per example, say) calls this directly instead of hand-
      # copying the sequence.

      # registry, without this guard, would get each file DISPATCHED AND JUDGED
      # ALONE the moment it loaded — and a lone file like `aggregate.bluebook`
      # refuses immediately, since `Aggregate.Attribute` references `ValueObject`
