    # A value object — a DECLARATION HOLDER, never instantiated.
    #
    # `ValueObjectBuilder` returns an anonymous subclass whose singleton
    # carries the declaration : attributes, invariants, members. Nothing ever
    # calls `.new` on one — coercion builds `Runtime::Value` wrappers, and
    # invariants run as canonical text through the Evaluator. The runtime
    # reaches a shape through `aggregate.value_object(name)`, the IR's own
    # finder ; there is no constant nesting and no second index.
    #
    # `to_h` does not move. It is a byte-for-byte contract pinned by the
    # golden fixtures, so it keeps spelling the short declared name, which
    # is what `hecks_name` carries. DECLARATIONS IN THE GRAPH, STRINGS IN THE
    # EXPORT.
