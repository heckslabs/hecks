      # `identified_by` — SHARED by AggregateBuilder and EntityBuilder
      # only (S9, ADR 0025 — "EntityBuilder's duplicate identified_by and
      # resolve_pending_identity! go"): a piece's own identity cannot
      # spell differently from its aggregate's, and until this slice it
      # was hand-duplicated onto both rather than shared.
      #
      # A SEPARATE MODULE from AttributeCollector on purpose — every
      # `attribute()`-taking builder (Command, Query, PortOperation,
      # ValueObject, ...) `include`s that one too, and none of THEM
      # declares an identity of its own ; folding `identified_by` in
      # there made it answer for six builders that never earned the
      # word (`syntax_conformance_spec.rb` catches exactly this — a
      # builder answering a method the grammar never grants it).
      #
      # Requires its includer to ALSO `include AttributeCollector`
      # (for `attributes`/`resolve_identity_field!`/`resolve_identity_
      # type!`, still declared there since every includer of THAT
      # module needs them) and to supply `identity_pool` (private) —
      # the value-object list a bare field's own type resolves
      # against: AggregateBuilder's own `@value_objects + closed_sets`,
      # or EntityBuilder's OWNER's, since a piece mints none of its own.

        # There are three live forms, deliberately distinguishable at the
        # declaration site:
        #
        #   identified_by AccountNumber, as: :number # one identity concept
        #   identified_by do ... end                 # a bespoke concept
        #   identified_by :branch, :number           # an existing compound key
        #
        # One symbol is retired: it cannot say whether the author means a
        # value concept or a field-shaped database key. Frozen source still
        # reaches the old interpretation through `legacy_identified_by`.
        # RENAMED FROM `identified_by` — item #13's full metaprogrammed
        # dispatch (slice 4c), same shared-mixin shape `attribute_impl`
        # already proved in slice 3: ONE renamed method, both Aggregate
        # and Entity Keyword rows name it in `calls:`. Bootstrap-
        # reachable (every self-hosted aggregate/entity declares an
        # identity), so in BOOTSTRAP_CALLS_FALLBACK for both contexts.
        # Dispatches across the three live forms documented above (value-
        # object + block, single type target, single/compound field
        # target), each an early return that sets exactly one pending
        # ivar. Splitting per form would need each branch's own `return`-
        # with-nil semantics and the shared `@name`/`identity_pool`
        # threaded back out as parameters, for no gain beyond what the
        # three-forms comment above already documents.
