      # ITEM #13's FULL METAPROGRAMMED DISPATCH — slices 1-2 of 4, whole-
      # project table-unification survey. WordGate (the first slice,
      # already shipped) only CHECKS a word's admissibility; this module
      # EXECUTES the safe, mechanical subset of what a word actually
      # DOES, read live off the SAME self-hosted grammar table — so a
      # builder method for one of these words no longer needs to be
      # hand-written at all. Called from `WordGate#method_missing`'s own
      # "admitted here, no builder method for it yet" branch, so it only
      # ever sees a word whose (context, word) pair the grammar already
      # admits.
      #
      # SCOPE, deliberately narrow and VERIFIED word-by-word — a full
      # audit read every real Ruby builder method's own source before
      # any of this was written, not inferred from the table's shape
      # alone (which fooled a first pass: `ReadModelBuilder#group_by`/
      # `#include` LOOK like plain fills from `kind`/`fills` alone, but
      # actually wrap their arguments in a Hash/tuple). What's covered:
      #
      #   - a SINGLE, non-variadic, positional Argument row whose value
      #     is stored with nothing beyond a uniform, kind-driven
      #     coercion (`COERCE_BY_KIND`) — or, for `kind: "text"`, no
      #     coercion at all when the row's own `coerce: "false"` says so
      #     (six real, audited exceptions: `.to_s` on an actual String
      #     is a same-object no-op for every real corpus use, but a
      #     genuine behavior change for a direct Ruby API call passing
      #     something else)
      #   - a scalar ASSIGN (`@ivar = value`) or list APPEND (`@ivar <<
      #     value`), chosen by whether the ivar `fills:` names is
      #     ALREADY an Array at call time (every candidate's own
      #     `initialize` pre-populates its accumulating ivars as `[]` —
      #     read live, not assumed)
      #   - a ZERO-ARGUMENT word, either (a) one of several sibling
      #     Keyword rows in the SAME context sharing the SAME `fills:`
      #     target — derives its own stored value from ITS OWN word
      #     name as a symbol (`core`/`generic`/`supporting` all fill
      #     `classification`), or (b) the ONLY Keyword row filling its
      #     own `fills:` target — a bare marker, stores literal `true`
      #     (`ReadModel#count`)
      #   - an OPENS_BLOCK word named in `SAFE_OPENS_BLOCK` below,
      #     verified to do NOTHING beyond "build the child, instance_
      #     eval the block against it, append the result" — see that
      #     constant's own comment
      #   - (slice 2) a single-fill word whose row also names a `blank_
      #     message:` — raises that EXACT Malformed text if the coerced
      #     value is blank, before storing it, matching a real hand-
      #     written guard exactly (`Translation#retired`/
      #     `TranslationAggregate#drop`, the only two words in the whole
      #     grammar with this precise shape — `required: "true"` alone
      #     only gates Ruby's own arity, never a present-but-blank
      #     value, and most `required: "true"` words do NOT raise on
      #     blank, so this needed a real per-row signal, not an
      #     assumption from `required:` alone)
      #
      # Explicitly OUT of this slice (found live, during the audit, not
      # assumed) — stays hand-written, unaffected, until a later slice's
      # own new table columns (`gated_by:`/`calls:`) can name
      # what it really does: variadic accumulation with a real transform
      # (`attaches_to`); source-block extraction (`ensures`, `where`);
      # Struct/Hash-wrapping (`limit`, `group_by`, `rekey`); a guard
      # clause NOT reducible to a plain blank-check (`role`'s own "raise
      # if ALREADY set" uniqueness gate — a genuinely different shape
      # from `retired`/`drop`'s own blank-check, needing its own
      # design); a dynamically-BUILT refusal message rather than one
      # fixed string (`TranslationAggregateBuilder#unresolved` — real
      # branching logic choosing between several message shapes, not a
      # simple "always refuses" flag; belongs with `calls:`, slice 4,
      # where a table row can name the real Ruby helper that already
      # builds it); a side effect beyond storage (`uses_framework`,
      # `uses_embryonaut_bluebook`); an opens-block word threading extra
      # constructor args to its child (`asks`/`tells`/`operation`,
      # `Bluebook#aggregate`, `Translation#aggregate`) or doing anything
      # beyond a bare fold after building (`Aggregate#policy`'s stamp,
      # `Aggregate#value_object`'s flatten, `Hecksagon#port`'s resolver-
      # swap-and-branch); the DEFERRED-build queue pattern (`Aggregate`/
      # `Entity`'s own `command`/`entity`/`query`); the shadow_parsing?-
      # gated words (`has_many`/`has_one`/`belongs_to`/`then_set`/
      # `trigger`/`dispatch`/`one_of` — each delegates to its own
      # `legacy_*` method under `MetaValidator.shadow_parsing?`, else
      # refuses; a genuinely different two-branch shape per word, closer
      # to `calls:`'s own territory than a simple fill); and every
      # `File`-context word (routes through `Runtime.current_registry`,
      # a side effect this module has no business performing).
      #
      # TWO FURTHER, DIFFERENT reasons a word can look table-safe and
      # still be excluded, both found live rather than assumed:
      #   - BOOTSTRAP REACHABILITY. `WordGate`'s own gate steps aside
      #     entirely while `MetaValidator.bootstrapping?` (the meta-
      #     domain's own circularity — its grammar table doesn't exist
      #     yet to read), and `load_grammar_into` loads REAL `.port`/
      #     `.adapter` files, plus every core `.bluebook` chapter, DURING
      #     that exact window. Any word those files actually call (found
      #     to be nearly every common one — `vision`/`core`/`generic`/
      #     `supporting`/`description`/`goal`/`emits`/`role`/`identified_
      #     by` describe literally every self-hosted aggregate/command)
      #     has NO working method to fall back on if its hand-written
      #     `def` is removed — `super` from `WordGate#method_missing`
      #     just raises `NoMethodError`. `PortBuilder`/`AdapterBuilder`/
      #     `BluebookBuilder` turned out to be entirely off-limits to
      #     this slice for exactly this reason, confirmed by cold-
      #     booting `MetaValidator.grammar_registry` after each
      #     candidate removal, not assumed safe from reading the table
      #     alone.
      #   - A CONFLICTING HAND-WRITTEN `method_missing`. `WorldBuilder`
      #     and `HecksagonBuilder` each define their OWN `method_missing`
      #     directly on the class (for genuinely open-ended settings/
      #     collector verbs) — a method defined directly on a class always
      #     wins over one from an included module in Ruby's own method
      #     resolution, so `WordGate`'s (and this module's) own
      #     `method_missing` never runs for THEIR builders at all. Their
      #     own candidate words (`realm`/`latest`, `subscribe`) stay
      #     hand-written for this structural reason, independent of
      #     whether their own behavior would otherwise qualify.
