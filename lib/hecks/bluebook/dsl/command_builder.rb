        # returns, never the builder's own object graph directly, confirmed
        # by reading `meta_validator.rb`'s own `self.call`/`self.hold`).
        # A genuinely NEW top-level Command field needs the meta-domain's
        # own grammar (`language/bluebook/behavior.bluebook` or wherever

        # instead of inventing a parallel one. `MutationOp`'s own closed set
