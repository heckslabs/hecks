      # THE RUBY-SIDE `word_gate` (`rust/parser/src/parse/mod.rs`'s own,
      # read there first — this is the same job, one level up: Rust's own
      # gate refuses a mistyped/inadmissible WORD directly, at the
      # moment it reads a line of `.bluebook` SOURCE TEXT, before any
      # per-construct parsing runs. Ruby never lexes source text — a
      # `.bluebook` file IS Ruby, so `given("x")` is ALREADY a real
      # method call by the time any of this code runs, and Ruby's own
      # method dispatch already refuses an ARITY mismatch on an
      # EXISTING method for free. What Ruby's own dispatch does NOT do
      # is consult the self-hosted grammar table AT ALL — a mistyped
      # word (`giv3n("x")`) or a word used in the wrong context
      # (`identified_by` inside a `command` block) just raises Ruby's
      # own generic `NoMethodError`, naming nothing about what the
      # language actually admits. This module closes that gap.
      #
      # `method_missing`/`respond_to_missing?` ONLY — a word this
      # builder class already answers with an ordinary `def` (or a
      # shared mixin method like `AttributeCollector#attribute`) never
      # reaches this module at all; Ruby's own method lookup finds it
      # first, and item #13's later slices haven't removed every one of
      # those yet. This WAS "zero behavior change for every currently-
      # valid line in the entire corpus" in its own first slice — since
      # item #13's full metaprogrammed dispatch (slice 1, whole-project
      # table-unification survey) started REMOVING the hand-written
      # methods this module's own admissibility check used to defer to,
      # some words now execute for real here too, via `GenericDispatch`
      # — see that module's own header for exactly which ones, and the
      # full account of what was verified before each was migrated. A
      # mistyped or wrongly-contexted word still gets the same real,
      # helpful, table-driven refusal Rust's own `word_gate` already
      # gives, instead of Ruby's own generic `NoMethodError` — that half
      # is genuinely unchanged.
      #
      # `self.class::GRAMMAR_CONTEXT` — each including class names which
      # row of the self-hosted `Context` closed set it corresponds to
      # (`AggregateBuilder::GRAMMAR_CONTEXT = "Aggregate"`, etc.) — the
      # SAME string `word_gate`'s own `context` parameter already is on
      # the Rust side, read off the identical table.
      #
      # BOOTSTRAPPING GATED, the same reason `RuleReference#lookup`
      # already is (`rule_reference.rb`'s own comment has the full
      # story) — the meta-domain's own bootstrap calls dozens of
      # keywords on itself before its own grammar table exists to
      # check them against. For most words, this module steps aside
      # entirely during bootstrap (`super`, Ruby's own ordinary
      # `NoMethodError`) — the exact behavior every builder already had
      # before this module existed, and (unlike `RuleReference`) there
      # is deliberately no fallback covering the whole ~200-row table —
      # that would defeat the entire point.
      #
      # ONE NARROW EXCEPTION, added in item #13's full metaprogrammed
      # dispatch (slice 3, whole-project table-unification survey):
      # `GenericDispatch::BOOTSTRAP_CALLS_FALLBACK`, a SMALL, EXPLICIT
      # table naming the same (context, word) -> method pairs the real
      # `calls:` column would say once it exists — used ONLY for words
      # BOTH migrated to the `calls:` shape AND bootstrap-reachable
      # (`attribute`, today). This is the one place in this whole arc a
      # bootstrap fallback was worth building despite `RuleReference`'s
      # own precedent against it: it duplicates NO logic, only a METHOD
      # NAME — `attribute_impl`'s own real, hand-written body is called
      # either way, bootstrap or not, so there is nothing here that can
      # drift the way a full behavioral duplicate could.
      #
      # TWO FURTHER PIECES, both slice 5:
      #   - `word_gate_dispatch` is the same admission+dispatch logic
      #     `method_missing` below runs, factored out so a class with
      #     its OWN class-level `method_missing` (`HecksagonBuilder`'s/
      #     `WorldBuilder`'s genuinely open-ended verb vocabulary) can
      #     call it directly and fall back to its own open-verb handling
      #     only when this returns `NOT_ADMITTED` — a class-level `def`
      #     always wins over an included module's in Ruby's own method
      #     resolution, so their OWN `method_missing` is the only one
      #     that ever runs for them, and this is what lets a real,
      #     closed-set word (`port`/`realm`/`latest`) still reach
      #     `GenericDispatch` despite that.
      #   - the "Type"-position fallback inside `word_gate_dispatch`
      #     itself, for `one_of`/`list_of` — called inside an
      #     attribute's own type argument, with `self` as whatever
      #     builder is currently `instance_eval`ing, never a dedicated
      #     "Type" builder `self.class::GRAMMAR_CONTEXT` could ever
      #     name. See that method's own comment.
