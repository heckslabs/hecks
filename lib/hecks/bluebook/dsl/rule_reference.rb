      # THE THREE RESOLUTION PRIMITIVES the S10 given/invariant family's
      # own "declared once, referenced by name" mechanism (ADR 0025)
      # reduces to, at every scope this language has grown one so far
      # (a command referencing its owner or a sibling piece's entity-wide
      # pool; an aggregate referencing another aggregate chapter-wide; a
      # value object referencing a sibling value object on the same
      # aggregate) — extracted here, once, so the NEXT scope this family
      # widens to (there will be one — see docs/resolution-rules/
      # chapter-given.md's own "Known limitations" for two already named)
      # reuses one of these three shapes instead of a fourth hand-written
      # near-duplicate resolver.
      #
      # NOT ONE UNIFIED ALGORITHM — a real design question this file
      # answers directly: the THREE existing resolvers are not
      # superficially different, they are STRUCTURALLY different (a
      # multi-pool fallback CHAIN; ONE pool keyed by declaring OWNER,
      # needing disambiguation; a LIVE SCAN over already-built sibling
      # objects with no separate pool at all) — forcing them into one
      # shape would be a real behavior change (see `#lookup`, below, for
      # which construct uses which), not the pure internal refactor this
      # module is. `build_rule` is the one piece that WAS genuinely
      # identical across all 7 declaring methods (`given`×3,
      # `invariant`×3, `ensures`×1) before this file existed — extract
      # predicate source, refuse if extraction failed, build the struct.
      #
      # `#lookup`/`#verify_resolves_via!` read WHICH construct uses which
      # primitive off the self-hosted grammar table itself
      # (`Keyword#resolves_via`, `syntax.bluebook`) — not a Ruby-only
      # Hash cross-checked afterward (this file's OWN earlier shape, one
      # round ago) — so a real domain's own boot, not just `bundle exec
      # rspec`, fails loudly the moment the table and this file's own
      # hand-written resolution methods disagree.
