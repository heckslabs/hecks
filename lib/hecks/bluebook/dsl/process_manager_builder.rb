        # `from:` — including the array form Lifecycle's own commands
        # could already take and a process manager's own events could
        # not — and the states a procedure runs on are DERIVED from the
        # transitions that name them, the same way `Behaviour::Lifecycle

        # duplicated exactly what the transition list already said,

        # `starts_on`/`ends_on` are NOT unified into this — verified

        # `ends_on "TransferSettled"` names an event NONE of its own
        # transitions ever handle (`Transfer.Settle`'s own emission, a
        # full step downstream of the transition that dispatches it),
        # so "the terminal state's own event" is not a fact the
        # transition graph carries — deriving it would either be wrong
