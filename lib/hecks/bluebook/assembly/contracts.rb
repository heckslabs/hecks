    # Reopened here for `CONTRACTS`/`.contract(category)` — the one table of
    # every construct category's own `Contract` (Bluebook, Aggregate,
    # Command, ValueObject, Query, ...); see `Contract`'s own header
    # (contract.rb) for the struct format each entry below fills in.
    class Assembly
      # ONE TABLE, WHERE THERE WERE FIVE HAND-WRITTEN MIRRORS OF IT.
      #
      # `bluebook.bluebook` already declares what every construct is made of, and
      # `Plan` already reads it — parent, fields, lists, setters. What the language
      # cannot say is the three things Ruby needs to rebuild one, so those are here
      # and ONLY those:
      #
      #   holder    which class holds it
      #   make      :declare for a construct that became a class, :new for an
      #             instance — the boundary `Query` sits on, since its body is
      #             inherited instance methods
      #   fields    each keyword the constructor takes, as
      #             keyword => [key in the declaration, how to read it]
      #
      # A READER is a symbol naming a method on Marks, or :plain for a value that
      # needs no decoding, or [:each, reader] for a list. Nothing here is a rule
      # about whether a declaration is admissible — the language settled that on the
      # way in. This is only how a spelling becomes an object again.
      #
      # WHY A TABLE AND NOT A METHOD PER CATEGORY. The judge used to carry one
      # hand-written branch per category, and the price was fourteen verbs the
      # language declared and the walk never offered — every rule hanging off them
      # decoration, and nothing red, because a branch that does not exist cannot
      # fail. An assembler with a method per category is the same shape. So the
      # table is checked AGAINST the language by spec/assembly_spec: a field the
      # language declares that no contract consumes is a failure, not a silence.
      #
      # The `derived` list is how a field says it needs no assembling — a parent
      # pointer the containment tree already knows, or something computed from what
      # is here (`query_name` is `Naming.snake(name)`, `creates?` is whether a verb
      # names a root). Naming one is a claim, and the coverage gate holds it.
