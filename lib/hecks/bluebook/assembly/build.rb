      # ONE WAY TO BUILD A CONSTRUCT, for every construct.
      #
      # There used to be a method per category here — `value_object(row)`,
      # `command(row)`, `policy(row)` — each one gathering the same keywords the
      # contract already names. This reads the contract instead, so adding a field
      # to the language and forgetting to assemble it is caught by the coverage gate
      # rather than by nobody.
      #
      # `make` is the only branch, and it is a real one: a construct that became a
      # class is `.declare`d, an instance is `.new`ed. That is the boundary
      # `Query` sits on, and it is a fact about Ruby rather than about the
      # domain.
