      # THE FIRST SPECIALIZER — a projection of `contracts.rb`'s `fields:` table,

      # hand-written beside it.
      #
      # `Plan` already reads `grammar_registry` to build the judge's walk ; this
      # reads the same chapter to build the OTHER table this arc's own header
      # names as duplication — "SPELLED AS THE IR SPELLS THEM," field for field,
      # for every category simple enough to say so.
      #
      # ONE CASE, PROVEN, NOT THE WHOLE TABLE. A field this can speak for is
      # scalar and not a reference — every other field (a list, a reference, a
      # fold like Lifecycle) is exactly what `contracts.rb`'s `reads:`/`derived:`
      # exist to say, and stays hand-written until a later projection learns to
      # derive readers and folds too. Restricting the claim to what can be
      # PROVEN CORRECT — checked in spec/specializer_spec.rb against two
      # independent categories — is the same discipline `derived:` itself
      # enforces : a claim needs a kind, and this one's kind is "plain, checked."

        # it hangs off some aggregate's own `.entities` instead
        # (searched recursively, the same reason `Value::Coercion#find_
        # entity` does: a NESTED entity, like `Dispatch` inside
        # `Handler`, is not a direct child of any aggregate either).

        # position ; it does not say a category's OWN constructor is handed
        # one, and that second fact is exactly what `fields:` needs to answer.
        # So the skip reads the category's own walk claims (`Contract#walked`)

        # walk-minted position, skips nothing.
