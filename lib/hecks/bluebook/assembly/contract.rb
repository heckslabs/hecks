      # field needs no assembling is CHECKED.
      #
      # `derived:` used to be a list of names, and a list of names is a promise with
      # nobody holding it. The coverage gate only asked whether a field was accounted
      # for — so writing `derived: %i[version]` would have satisfied it while dropping
      # a chapter's version in silence, which is the exact shape of every defect this
      # arc has found. Naming a field derived is a CLAIM, and a claim needs a kind:
      #
      #   :parent            the containment tree supplies it — a `*_id`, or one of
      #                      the named pointers below. Checked against the name.
      #   :children          it is assembled as child constructs. Checked against the
      #                      language: a category must exist whose parent is this one.
      #   [:computed, :m]    the holder works it out. Checked: it must answer to `m`.
      #   [:folded, keys]    several language fields are one thing in the IR, or one
      #                      is spread across several. Checked: every key must appear
      #                      in a real reconstructed declaration.
      #   :elsewhere         not a fact about this construct at all. Allow-listed one
      #                      by one, because it is the kind with no other check.
      #
      # Every one of those can FAIL. That is the whole difference.

        # drives BOTH directions: the walk reads the member on the way in, and the
        # reconstruction gathers the members back into the object on the way out.
        #
        # A nil member means the fold has no single member to name — `rows` is a
        # count of what `closed_set` and `members` hold between them, and `options`
