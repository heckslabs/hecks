    # The compensation half of a procedure, as its own thing.
    #
    # A PROCESS MANAGER coordinates: legs, states, an opinion about who goes
    # next. A SAGA undoes: what makes the world good again when a leg it
    # dispatched is refused. Two concepts, and the industry slurs them into one
    # word — so here they are two objects, and a procedure either has a saga or
    # does not.
    #
    # `undoes` is the ordered list of commands the compensation sends — a
    # STATIC PREVIEW, declaration order (`Behaviour::ProcessManager#saga`),
    # not one instance's own runtime history. Per-dispatch compensation
    # (`compensates`, on the step it compensates for) moved most of what
    # a saga undoes off this leg's own hand-written body and onto
    # whichever forward dispatch each one undoes — this reads every
    # declared `compensates` across the WHOLE saga first, then whatever
    # this leg's own hand-written body still lists, for compensation
    # that isn't expressible as "undo command X." WHICH of a declared
    # `compensates` actually fires for one instance, and in what order
    # (newest-first, completed-legs-only), is `SagaInterpreter`'s own
    # dynamic `completed_compensations` — a per-instance runtime fact
    # this declaration-only object could never hold.

    # NAMING COLLISION, ONCE FLAGGED, NOW RESOLVED — `command`'s own
    # `corrects event, reverses: true` (docs/implemented/decisions/0036-
    # corrects-is-an-appended-fact-not-a-rewrite.md) already claimed
    # `reverses` for a different meaning: auto-deriving a command's OWN
    # corrective mutation from a past EVENT, not a saga's own
    # compensating leg from a past DISPATCH. This feature keeps
    # `reverses` reserved for `corrects` and uses `compensates` for
    # per-dispatch saga compensation instead — a deliberate choice, not
    # an accidental collision.
