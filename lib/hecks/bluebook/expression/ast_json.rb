      # ── AST → JSON — walks the REAL Evaluator/Resolver AST (the same
      # objects a live dispatch parses `given`/`ensures`/invariant text
      # into — see docs/implemented/guides/running-a-runtime.md's "The
      # expression grammar") and emits plain, JSON-serializable Ruby
      # Hashes, tagged by `"op"`.
      #
      # THE SAME TWO-METHOD WALK `rust/project/expr_emitter.rb`'s own
      # `emit_bool`/`emit_resolver` already do, over the SAME AST — that
      # file's own methods build RUST SOURCE-CODE STRINGS for `rust/
      # project`'s codegen (`rust/src/kernel::expr::Expr` literals, baked
      # into a generated domain's own compiled binary); this builds DATA
      # instead, for a genuinely different consumer with a genuinely
      # different constraint: `rust/host` can never link the `rust`
      # (kernel) crate at all (a real, load-bearing build constraint —
      # `reference_validate.rs`'s own header has the full reasoning: one
      # path dependency would statically bake every domain's generated
      # dispatch code into every Lambda binary), so a value object's own
      # `invariant` predicate has to travel as something `rust/host` can
      # deserialize and interpret itself, at RUNTIME, from `ir.json` — the
      # exact same relationship `rust/project`'s own `Expr` literals
      # already have to the compiled kernel, one layer further out.
      #
      # LIVES IN CORE `lib/hecks`, NOT `rust/project/` — `rust/project.rb`
      # is a separate, downstream toolchain
      # (`lib/hecks/projector.rb`'s own header: "a whole separate Ruby
      # program"), never `require`d by core `lib/hecks/bluebook/*.rb`
      # files (confirmed: no core file does). `value_object.rb`'s own
      # `invariants:` IR emission needs this for EVERY domain's ordinary
      # `to_h`/`ir.json` export — golden fixtures, `hecks-parse`'s parity
      # comparisons, and any deploy artifact, not only a `bin/project_rust`
      # run — so it belongs beside `Evaluator`/`Resolver` themselves, not
      # bolted onto a tool that only sometimes runs.
      #
      # COMPLETE, not corpus-scoped: every node this grammar admits gets
      # a real arm, the identical "raise, don't silently drop" discipline
      # `expr_emitter.rb`'s own `emit_bool`/`emit_resolver` already hold
      # to — even though, as of this writing, no real corpus VALUE OBJECT
      # invariant exercises `Include`/`Modulo`/`BlockPredicate`/`Find`/
      # `Array`/`MatchesRegex`/`Presence`/`Assignment`/`Split`/`StartsWith`/
      # `EndsWith`/`First`/`Last` (only `given`/`ensures` clauses do, elsewhere in
      # the corpus — a different consumer of this same grammar).
      # `rust/host/src/expr_json.rs`'s own header names exactly which of
      # these its interpreter evaluates for real today versus refuses
      # cleanly — a narrower, deliberate, documented boundary on the
      # INTERPRETING side, not on this EMITTING side: an author is free
      # to write ANY real expression in a value object's own `invariant`,
      # and this always emits it faithfully; whether `rust/host` can yet
      # CHECK it at mint time is that file's own question to answer, not
      # this one's to pre-empt by refusing to even try.
