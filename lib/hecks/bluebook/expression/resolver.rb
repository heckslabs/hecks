        # `expects "..." do trash_day.present? end`-shaped bare
        # comparison against a raw literal. Confirmed corpus-wide, not
        # one file's mistake: bin-buddy alone has this exact `field ==
        # "literal"` shape in plan.bluebook, service_task.bluebook,
        # route.bluebook, and subscription.bluebook, all equally silent
        # until a real dispatch (never validate) exercised the
        # predicate. Scoped narrowly to the single-field `{value: X}`
        # shape only.
        #
        # UPDATE 2026-08-18: originally scoped to unwrap ONLY the bare
        # (undotted) case, on the belief that a dotted lookup only ever
        # reaches into a VO's OWN field (`field.value`, `field.sub_
        # field`) and so should keep walking `#[]` untouched. That
        # belief held for the single-hop case but not for the general
        # one: a dotted lookup that NAVIGATES THROUGH an entity/list
        # element to a nested field (`leg.voyage`, where `voyage` is
        # itself a single-field VO) landed on the very same unwrapped-
        # `Value` shape the bare case fixed, and hit the identical
        # silent `Value#==` failure -- comparing it against a raw
        # literal or another unwrapped VO returned false for everything,
        # no error. The terminal value of a dotted walk deserves the
        # same "this VO IS its scalar" treatment as a bare lookup's
        # result; only the INTERMEDIATE hops need raw `#[]` addressing
        # to keep navigating. `unwrap_scalar` is idempotent on an
        # already-raw scalar (a String/Integer doesn't respond to
        # `#to_h`), so this is safe for the existing `field.value`-
        # shaped dotted lookups too -- they already returned a raw
        # scalar and are unaffected.
        # UPDATE (single-element value objects strictly answer `.value`):
        # the unwrap used to gate on the sole key being literally NAMED
        # `:value` — correct for the shorthand/closed-set shapes that
        # motivated it, but a lie of omission for `Money{amount}` and
        # every other single-field value object whose author picked a
        # domain name for the field: the SAME "this VO IS its scalar"
        # reading ([[feedback_name_the_scalar_field]], `Behaviour::
        # ValueObject#sole_attribute`) applies regardless of what the
        # sole field happens to be called, and the name gate made a bare
        # `balance > 0` work for a `Balance{value}` while silently
        # comparing a whole VO for a `Balance{amount}`. Now the COUNT is
        # the gate, never the name. A declared `Runtime::Value` reads
        # its own `sole_attribute` (the declaration's answer, not the
        # stored hash's); any OTHER to_h-able (a Struct, a bespoke
        # wrapper with no declaration to consult) keeps the original
        # `{value: X}`-only unwrap, so nothing that never was a value
        # object gains a surprise unwrapping. `rust/src/kernel/json.rs`'s
        # `impl Fielded for Json` mirrors the count-only reading on the
        # Rust side — change them in lockstep or rust_conformance
        # diverges.
