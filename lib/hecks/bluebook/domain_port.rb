    # The primary/driving half of hexagonal architecture (Cockburn) — called
    # by an adapter living outside the bluebook entirely, never by the
    # domain calling out. That is already `Hecks.port` (persistence,
    # projection, extraction, loading) plus `Ports::*` : the secondary/
    # driven half, unchanged by this.
    #
    # An operation carries no `given`/`ensures`/`then_set` — a port is the
    # anti-corruption boundary that turns an external call into a fact in
    # this domain's own vocabulary, not a second place business rules live.
    # Those stay on whatever command a `policy` triggers in reaction to the
    # event an operation emits.

      # `:inbound` is what this class has always been — `tells`, spelled
      # `operation` before it had a twin: an external fact arriving, turned
      # into this domain's own event. It emits and that is all; there is no
      # channel back to whoever called.
      #
      # `:outbound` is `asks` — the domain wanting something from outside
      # and having to live with either answer. It names both: `answers` for
      # what the adapter came back with, `refuses` for what it said instead.
      # Naming only the happy one would put the failure somewhere the model
      # cannot see, which is the whole reason a boundary is worth modelling.

      # No root reference of its own — unlike a command, every attribute
      # equally describes the payload, including whichever one identifies
      # the record its emitted event belongs to. Kept only so
      # CommandInterpreter::ArgumentGate's `reference_key` can ask for it
      # without learning this isn't a command.

      # `direction`/`answers`/`refuses` are deliberately outside `emits_ir`'s
      # declared shape and added here only for an outbound operation — an
      # ordinary inbound one (`tells`, still spelled `operation` everywhere
      # in the existing corpus) keeps the exact prior IR shape, byte for
      # byte. Pizzas' `PaymentGateway` port is inbound-only and is checked
      # against `hecks-parse`'s own Rust output for byte-identity
      # (parser_parity_spec.rb) — the Rust side has no notion of `asks` yet,
      # so an unconditional new key here would break that parity for a
      # domain that never asked for the feature. Only a chapter that
      # actually declares `asks` (this extraction's own QualityControl
      # ledger, not yet in any Rust-parity corpus) pays for it.
      # `to` — same "deliberately outside emits_ir, merged in only when
      # present" treatment as direction/answers/refuses just above, and
      # for the identical reason: an operation still spelled the old way
      # (`reference_to` inside the block, shadow-parsing only — see
      # reference_to_impl's own comment) or one that simply hasn't
      # migrated yet keeps the exact prior IR shape, byte for byte,
      # instead of an unconditional new key breaking parser_parity_spec
      # for every domain that never touched this.
