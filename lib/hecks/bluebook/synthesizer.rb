    # ONE SYNTHESIZED ARGUMENT PER DECLARED ATTRIBUTE — never a random
    # guess. Reads only real `IR` (`Aggregate`, `Command`,
    # `Attribute`, `ValueObject`), so it works against ANY
    # loaded bluebook, not one particular domain: a String becomes a
    # fixed marker; an Integer becomes 0; a closed set uses ITS OWN
    # first admitted member (never a value a real `one_of` would
    # legitimately refuse); a reference uses whatever id the CALLER
    # already knows for that target (`created`), so a command whose
    # own shape depends on an earlier-created record — a `TripItem`
    # needing a real `PackingItem`, say — gets something real to work
    # with instead of a guess that would only ever fail.
    #
    # Extracted from `bin/interview`'s own smoke test, where this first
    # got built and proved — the logic never actually knew anything
    # about the Interview domain or any one app; it only ever read IR.
    module Synthesizer
      # THE ONLY TYPE NAMES THAT ARE EVER TRULY SCALAR — anything else
      # a value object's own field names is ANOTHER value object,
      # nested (`Pizza.price_cents: Price`, itself wrapping `cents:
      # Integer` — a real, ordinary shape, not an edge case). Missing
      # this the first time round meant a nested field silently
      # synthesized as the bare string `"smoke-test"` instead of the
      # real nested structure a command actually declares — caught
      # only by testing against Pizzas instead of re-testing against
      # the one simpler domain this was first built for, where every
      # value object happened to be single-field and primitive-typed.
      # THE SAME LIST `Attribute::PRIMITIVES` holds, referenced rather
      # than repeated. It was a second, byte-identical copy — and only
      # the Attribute one is held to `vocabulary.bluebook` by
      # spec/vocabulary_conformance_spec, so this copy could drift from
      # the language and nothing would say so.
