    # This used to be the string `"Reference<Customer>"`, minted by
    # `AggregateBuilder#reference_to` and `CommandBuilder#cross_reference` from
    # a real constant that had just been handed in, and then parsed back apart
    # by a regex in the command interpreter, by string equality in the read-model
    # interpreter and the SQLite adapter, and by `delete_prefix` in the bluebook
    # builder. Five readers of a spelling one writer invented.
    #
    # It holds the target instead, and answers `resolve` with the target's
    # Aggregate. Resolution is lazy and deliberately so: `reference_to
    # Customer` may name an aggregate declared lower in the file — banking's
    # Account points at Customer and survives only because Customer happens to
    # be written above — so the edge cannot be resolved at declaration time.
    # It resolves through the chapter's own IR (`Bluebook#aggregate`),
    # which is scoped by construction : the lookup cannot walk anywhere but
    # this chapter's declared heads, so a same-named aggregate in another
    # loaded domain is unreachable rather than defended against.
    #
    # `to_s` still spells `"Reference<Customer>"`, because `Attribute#to_h` is
    # part of the pinned byte-for-byte export contract. IR objects in
    # the graph, strings in the export.

      # attribute exists once, but its `held_type`/`current_type` come
      # from separately-parsed bluebooks with structurally different
      # (if same-shaped) owning aggregates, and `declared_in` is a
      # cross-reference for `resolve`, not part of what this attribute
