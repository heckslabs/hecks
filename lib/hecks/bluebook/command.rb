      # op NAME by two independent Rust codegen scripts (rust/project/
      # mutations.rb, rust/codegen/src/mutations.rs — a ternary on
      # `op == "increment"` in each), even though the fact was already
      # table-driven on the Ruby runtime side
      # (Runtime::CommandRules::Arithmetic::MUTATION_OPS, held equal to
      # Vocabulary::MutationOp by spec/vocabulary_conformance_spec.rb).
      # Reads `Vocabulary::MutationOp` directly (plain data, no framework
      # dependency — safe during parsing, same reason `RuleReference`'s
      # own bootstrap concerns don't apply here) rather than requiring
      # Runtime::CommandRules from the bluebook/IR layer, which would be a
      # real layering inversion (runtime depends on bluebook, not the

      # full reasoning for reusing this exact wire shape rather than
      # inventing a parallel one) binds several fields at once and carries
      # `fields:`, everything else carries a single `source:`. Declared
      # emission covers the fixed head; `super` supplies it and this adds
      # the tail, which is why a construct with a variable shape needs no
      # new mixin API.

    # A command, as a RUBY CLASS.
    #
    # NOT nested as a constant, and that is a finding rather than a shortcut. A
    # command and a value object may legitimately share a name inside one
    # aggregate — the language does it six times, and means it: the command
    # `Argument` is the verb that appends to the `arguments` list whose element
    # type is the value object `Argument`, and `Plan` reads exactly that pairing.
    # So `Bluebook::Command::Argument` cannot be both, and a single constant
    # namespace cannot index a kind-ambiguous name. The same follows for
    # `hecks_fqn` : `Bluebook::Command.Argument` names both, which is why the judge's
    # ids only work per-category, each in its own repository. IDENTITY IS
    # (KIND, FQN), not fqn.
    #
    # It is a declaration holder anyway, because that is where the EDGES live.
    # `acts_on` answers with the owning construct itself — the Aggregate,
    # or the entity holder for a piece's verb — rather than the name of one.
    # The invocation door (`pizza.add_topping`) is the facade's business, a
    # per-boot projection ; no verb method is defined here.
