    # An entity, as a RUBY CLASS — a piece of an aggregate that has an identity
    # of its own.
    #
    # Crossing over closes the OWNER CHAIN. An entity declares commands, and
    # until now those commands had no owner that could state an identity: an
    # entity was an IR object, not a construct, so `Construct#hecks_fqn` refused
    # rather than answering "Deposit" and looking right. Four of banking's
    # commands were in that state. They can say what they are now —
    # `Banking::Account.Ledger.Deposit` — which is the id the judge already mints
    # for them.
    #
    # NOT const_set, for the same reason a command is not: a name inside one
    # aggregate can denote more than one kind of thing, so the constant tree
    # cannot index it.
    #
    # It must stay STRUCTURALLY INTERCHANGEABLE with an aggregate — the runtime
    # builds `Instance.new(aggregate: entity)` and `CommandRules` takes either as
    # `declaring` — so it answers `hecks_name`, `attributes`, `attribute`,
    # `identified_by` and `lifecycle` exactly as an aggregate does. And it must
    # keep NOT answering `value_object`: `Value.for_attribute` sniffs for that
    # method to tell a piece from a head.
