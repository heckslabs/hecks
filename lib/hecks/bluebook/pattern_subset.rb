    # WHICH REGEXES A BLUEBOOK MAY SAY.
    #
    # A `pattern:` is a fact about a value, carried in a bluebook — declared
    # data, not Ruby code, so it must not lean on what any one engine happens
    # to accept. Regex engines disagree in two different ways :
    #
    #   ONLY A BACKTRACKING ENGINE CAN MATCH IT — lookahead, lookbehind,
    #   backreferences, atomic groups, possessive quantifiers. None of these
    #   can be matched in linear time, and linear-time engines refuse them
    #   outright. Refused here for the same reason.
    #
    #   EVERY ENGINE PARSES IT AND THEY MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS — the dangerous
    #   half, because nothing errors. `\d` `\w` `\s` are ASCII in some engines
    #   and Unicode in others ; `[:digit:]` and friends flip the same way in
    #   the other direction. Both families are refused, and a domain spells
    #   the range it means.
    #
    # What remains — explicit ranges, alternation, quantifiers, anchors,
    # groups — reads identically everywhere, with `^` and `$` as LINE anchors
    # (Ruby's reading). The evidence is spec/corpus/fixtures/patterns.json.

      # A CHARACTER WALK, deliberately plain : the subset is defined by this
      # walk, and a cleverer spelling would hide what it admits. An escaped
      # construct is a LITERAL, not a violation — `\(\?=` is the three
      # characters "(?=" and says nothing about lookahead — which is why this
      # steps over each backslash pair rather than matching the pattern as a
      # whole.
      # One character walk is the subset's DEFINITION (see the method
      # comment above): each construct-check is a branch in a single
      # ordered pass sharing `index`/`in_class`/`class_start`. Splitting
      # the branches into separate methods would force those three cursor
      # variables to thread as parameters/return values between them,
      # turning "the subset is this walk" into "the subset is these
      # methods agreeing about a shared cursor" — exactly what the walk's
      # own comment says a cleverer spelling would obscure.
