    # it `admits`. What `attribute :x, Type` (or `identified_by`,
    # `reference_to`, etc.) actually mints, on an Aggregate, Entity, Command,
    # ValueObject, Query or PortOperation alike.

      # A Reference is kept AS ITSELF. Every other type is still a name, and

      #
      # `admits` names an ALREADY-DECLARED closed set the value must belong
      # to — `Vocabulary::QueryComparator` — spelled aggregate-qualified
      # because the set is a value object INSIDE an aggregate, and the
      # aggregate is the only thing `reference_to` can reach.
      #
      # ON THE WIRE, because it is a RULE and not only a typing hint.
      #
      # It began as neither. The link existed so a generator could type
      # `WhereClause.op` as `WhereOp` — a typing convenience, not worth
      # moving 710 attribute records across eight goldens for. Then `admits`
      # grew teeth (coercion refuses a non-member) and the argument
      # inverted: a rule the wire does not carry is one a reader of the IR
      # cannot enforce, and a bluebook whose meaning depends on the reader
      # means two things. Proved rather than assumed — the same domain
      # refused "burnt" through one reading and emitted the event through
      # another.
      #
      # The wire carries the NAME, not the members. A reader resolves it
      # against the IR it holds, so the members are declared once and
      # copied nowhere — which is the same reason `admits` exists at all.

      # A BARE CONSTANT IN A BLUEBOOK IS A NAME, EVEN WHEN RUBY HAS HEARD OF IT.
      #
      # `BluebookBuilder.build` says exactly this and installs a `const_missing`
      # resolver that hands back the symbol — `attribute :target, Target` becomes
      # the name "Target" and nothing looks Target up. That works only while the
      # lookup FAILS, and `Facade::Surface` installs every aggregate name as a
      # TOP-LEVEL constant (its own comment, and `ConstShim`'s, both say so).
      #
      # So in one process: boot a domain with an aggregate named `Target`, then
      # load a chapter whose own value object is called `Target`, and Ruby
      # resolves the constant before the hook is ever asked. The chapter is then
      # built against somebody else's aggregate — silently, with no refusal —
      # and the attribute stops meaning what the file plainly says.
      #
      # DEMODULISED, so both paths spell it the same: `:Target` and
      # `QualityControl::Target` are both "Target". A plain class stays itself —
      # `String` demodulises to "String" — so the ordinary case is untouched.
      # This does not undo the constant leak; it makes the leak unable to change
      # what a chapter MEANS, which is the part that has to hold.
