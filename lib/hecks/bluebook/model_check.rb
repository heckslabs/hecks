    # Alloy/P: every lifecycle is a declared finite state machine and
    # every process manager a declared protocol, and BOTH are already
    # data, not code, so they can be MODEL-CHECKED rather than merely
    # executed. Static analysis only — no bluebook boots twice, no
    # runtime is touched — over what meta_validator/judge.rb and the
    # builders' own `validate!` methods leave uncovered (an undeclared
    # transition target, a dispatch to nowhere, a compensation nothing
    # can ever reach).
    #
    # THE RARE PROPERTY THIS RESTS ON: the model IS the implementation.
    # A checker over TLA+ verifies a SPEC a human keeps in sync with
    # code by hand ; this verifies the same IR the runtime dispatches
    # against, so there is no second copy to drift.

      # "banking"/ExternalSettlement — found on the first real run:
      # ExternalSettlement declares `ends_on "ExternalTransferSent"`, and
      # ExternalTransfer.Send genuinely emits it — the event is real, and
      # the AGGREGATE reaches "sent" (its own, separate lifecycle) — but
      # the SAGA'S protocol has no `on "ExternalTransferSent"` handler, so
      # its own `state "sent"` is unreachable through the chain the
      # checker walks, and the saga's own bookkeeping (saga_log, ends_on)
      # never closes it. Real domain activity is unaffected; the saga's
      # OWN tracking of it is not. Left named rather than redesigning a
      # corpus fixture that is not this checker's to redesign.
      # S7, ADR 0025 — the ExternalSettlement finding this used to
      # allowlist is GONE, not just quieted: its "sent" state was a
      # `state "x"` line never named by any handler's own from:/to:, a
      # pure declaration-drift artifact. States are DERIVED from the
      # transitions that name them now (ProcessManagerBuilder#derived_
      # states), so a state nothing ever transitions into or out of no
      # longer exists to be unreachable — the finding this allowlisted

      # or `subscribe` to. This is deliberate: `spec/runtime/policy_spec.
