module Hecks
  # The one place that knows how to freeze a domain value.
  #
  # Freezing here has been fixed four times in four places, each time by
  # topping the container and leaving the contents: list attributes, the
  # event log, query rows, and value objects. `.freeze` on a Hash stops a
  # key being added or removed and nothing else — the String, Array or
  # Hash a field holds stays mutable, so a caller reaches straight
  # through and edits in place. Each fix looked complete and none was.
  #
  # What should be frozen, and why it is not everything:
  #
  #   a value object has no identity to change over. `with` already
  #   answers a new one rather than mutating, so freezing it through is
  #   what it always claimed to be.
  #
  #   an emitted event is a record of something that happened. A mutable
  #   audit trail is not one.
  #
  #   a query row is an answer, not a handle — mutating one edits nobody's
  #   state and silently disagrees with the store.
  #
  #   an instance's state is not frozen, deliberately: the interpreter
  #   builds it up across a dispatch, and a command's whole job is to
  #   change it. Its values are frozen; the holder is not.
  #
  #   a command's arguments are not frozen either. They arrive from
  #   outside, are normalised and coerced on the way in, and the coerced
  #   result is what becomes a frozen value.

    # Numbers, symbols, nil and booleans are already immediate or frozen;
    # a Value froze itself when it was built. What is left is the mutable
    # trio, and each has to be walked rather than topped.
