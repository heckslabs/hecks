    # The JSON door — where Facade meets body-in/body-out callers.
    #
    # `Handle`/`Surface` are Ruby sugar over the dispatcher for a Ruby caller
    # holding real objects — a symbol verb name, a `**kwargs` payload, a
    # `Handle` back in hand. A rest-ish JSON API is a caller holding strings
    # instead: a URL segment naming a collection, a URL segment naming a
    # record or a verb, a parsed request body whose every key arrived as a
    # String because that is all JSON ever gives. Every app that wants to put
    # a JSON API in front of a booted domain has to do that translation —
    # name to class, string to symbol, nested `Runtime::Value` back to plain
    # data — and one sibling app had already hand-written it once, bespoke,
    # against its own routes, before this existed. This is that translation
    # pulled out, generic, reading the same IR the rest of the facade already
    # reads rather than re-deriving "how do I find an aggregate by name".
    #
    # No HTTP lives here. Same discipline `Router` and `Surface` already
    # hold: this module never sees a request object, never picks a status
    # code, never calls `halt`. Every method here takes plain Ruby values in
    # — a raw JSON String is the one exception, see `.parse` below, every
    # other input is already-parsed data — and returns plain Ruby values
    # out, or raises. Turning a raw request body into that input, and
    # turning a raised exception into an HTTP status, both stay the calling
    # app's job, exactly the way they already are for `Router#dispatch`.
    #
    # Every "that doesn't exist" case raises `Runtime::NotFound` — the same
    # class every time, not a new one per caller. `Runtime::NotFound` already
    # sits in `Runtime::DOMAIN_REFUSALS` (runtime/errors.rb) — the family a
    # booted app already has, or trivially can have, one generic `error`
    # handler for, mapping the whole family to a status code without a
    # special case per refusal. A bespoke `JsonDoor::CollectionNotFound` (or
    # three of those, one per flavor of "not found") would just force every
    # app that adopts this door to widen its rescue clause to match it — the
    # opposite of what a shared refusal family is for. So "no such
    # aggregate", "no creating command", "no such command", and "no record
    # with that id" all raise the one class, distinguished only by message.

      # "Banking", "Customer" -> the `Banking::Customer` class `.find` /
      # `.create_...` / etc already answer for — the same class

      # Checked against the current boot's IR first, not against Ruby's
      # constant table directly — a name that names nothing in this
      # registry should refuse before ever asking Ruby whether some
      # same-named constant happens to exist (possibly a stale one, left
      # over from an earlier boot in this same process — the exact hazard
      # `AggregateDoor#port`'s own comment describes at length). Only once
      # the IR confirms the aggregate is real does this read the constant
      # the current boot's `Surface.install` actually minted for it.

      # A URL segment or a JSON body's "command" field, checked against what
      # a `Handle` can actually dispatch — not `klass.commands`, which is
      # `AggregateDoor`'s own door-level list and includes the one creating
      # command too (`aggregate_door.rb`'s `commands` singleton method maps
      # every `ir.commands`, full stop). A `Handle` only ever defines
      # singleton methods for the non-creating ones
      # (`Handle#define_verb_methods`, `@ir.commands.reject(&:creates?)`) —
      # the creating command lives on the aggregate class itself, dispatched
      # through `.creating_command` above, not through a `Handle` in hand.
      # Accepting a creating-command name here let it past this gate clean,
      # only to blow up as a raw `NoMethodError` the moment a caller tried
      # `handle.public_send(name, **args)`, instead of the 404 this method
      # promises. Filtering `reject(&:creates?)` here, the same filter
      # `Handle` itself applies, is what keeps "accepted here" and

      # `materialize` on every field, so a value object three levels deep
      # unwraps three levels deep for free. This is not a second unwrapper
      # sitting next to it: `materialize` covers `Hash`/`Array`/`Value`
      # already, and a `Handle` is none of those three, so the one thing
