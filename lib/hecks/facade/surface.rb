    # The door, without the classes.
    #
    # `Pizzas::Pizza.create_pizza(...)` is the public surface (handover rule 3),
    # and this is what serves it now : anonymous per-boot modules whose
    # singleton methods close over the dispatcher and dispatch by FQN — the
    # same shape `Router::NamespaceInstaller` proved. Nothing here is a domain
    # class ; the IR is the only graph, and the door is a projection of it,
    # installed by `Loader.bind_runtime` and re-installed whole on the next
    # boot. How a chapter's module is built is surface/chapter.rb; how one
    # aggregate's door is built is surface/aggregate_door.rb.
    #
    # The hexagon-binding door rides along : `Pizzas::Pizza.persisted_by("Heki")`
    # in a `.hecksagon` file lands on the module's `method_missing`, which
    # records an `Bind` into whatever `HecksagonBuilder.collector` is open
    # at call time — so even a facade left over from a previous boot records
    # into the current builder, and a chapter with no constant at all falls
    # through to `ConstShim` → `BindingProxy`, which mints byte-identical binds.
    module Surface
      # These would shadow the machinery a Handle runs on, so a field named one
      # of them gets no reader and says so — the same warning the class door gave.
