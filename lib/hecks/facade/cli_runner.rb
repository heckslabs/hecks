    # THE RUNNER BEHIND A PROJECTED CLI.
    #
    # `Projector::CliProjector` answers what a domain's command line LOOKS
    # like; this is the twenty lines that parse against it and dispatch. It
    # lives in `lib/` rather than in a `bin/` because more than one front door
    # wants it — `bin/run` for whichever domain you are standing in, `bin/qc`
    # pinned to the QA ledger — and a second copy of the parse-and-dispatch
    # would be the exact duplication the projection exists to avoid.
    #
    # NO IO. It answers `[text, status]` and never prints or exits, so a spec
    # can call it without capturing streams or trapping SystemExit. The `bin/`
    # scripts do the printing, the same division `Router` and `JsonDoor`
    # already keep against HTTP.

      # THE CLOCK, FILLED IN AT THE DOOR.
      #
      # A staleness rule needs the time, and the sublanguage cannot ask for it
      # — a `given` that read the clock would judge the same record differently
      # on two runs, and every replay, audit and fuzz oracle here assumes it
      # does not. So `now` stays an ARGUMENT the predicate merely reads, and
      # the question becomes who types it. Before this, the caller did:
      #
      #   qa/quality_control target.claim id=QC held_by.value=me \
      #     now.value=$(date +%s) window.value=900
      #
      # which is a shell incantation in front of every claim, and one an agent
      # gets wrong by pasting a stale number.
      #
      # AT THE DOOR, NOT IN THE RUNTIME, and the distinction is load-bearing.
      # `Ports::IdentityGeneration` reasons the same question through for a
      # minted uuid and lands on "the value is baked into the caller's args at
      # the first live dispatch". A clock consulted INSIDE the interpreter
      # would not have that property — a recorded corpus step replayed
      # tomorrow would quietly get tomorrow's time, and the fuzzer's oracle and
      # the adapter-agreement gate both compare runs of exactly that shape. Here
      # it fills only what a person or an agent is typing, and `runtime.dispatch`
      # is left alone.
      #
      # AN EXPLICIT VALUE ALWAYS WINS, so a spec or a caller reproducing a
      # moment says so and is believed. This only supplies what was omitted.
      #
      # BY NAME, WHICH IS THE ONE UNCOMFORTABLE PART. `now` is a plausible
      # domain word and nothing declares that it means the clock. It is
      # tolerable because this is a convenience layer rather than semantics —
      # the verb's own help says the argument exists, dispatch is unchanged,
      # and passing it explicitly is always available. The honest version is a
      # declaration in the chapter (`attribute :now, Instant, from: :clock`),
      # which is a language change: DSL, IR, the self-hosted grammar and its
      # goldens. Worth doing; not worth smuggling in here.

      # A PORT OPERATION HAS NO STATE, AND ITS PAYLOAD IS THE ENTIRE POINT.
      #
      # A command answers with the record it changed, so naming the events is
      # enough — the interesting part is in `state`. A port operation changes
      # no record: it asked something outside and came back with what was
      # said, and that lives ONLY in the event payload. Reporting names alone
      # would print `SpecsCompleted` and drop the spec output on the floor.
      #
      # This is what makes a projected CLI usable as somebody's only door. An
      # agent that may not shell out cannot run `rspec` and read the terminal;
      # it asks the port and reads the answer, and if the answer is a bare
      # event name then the door leads nowhere and it needs a shell after all.
      #
      # BOTH ENDINGS COME BACK THE SAME WAY, and the status stays 0 for both.
      # A refusal here is not a misuse — `IssueStillOpen` and `SuiteFailed`
      # are answers the caller asked for, correctly delivered. Exit 1 is for
      # "you typed something wrong", and conflating the two would have a
      # scripted agent treat a healthy no as a broken call.
      def answered(handle)
        # THE ID COMES OFF THE EVENT, because a port operation hydrates no
        # instance and the handle's own `id` is nil by design. The event knows
        # which record was asked about — it was stamped with it — and printing
        # `null` beside a payload that plainly says `SW-TOOL` would read as a
        # bug in something.
