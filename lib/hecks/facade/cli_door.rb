    # **The CLI door** — where Facade meets a caller holding flat strings.
    #
    # `JsonDoor` beside this one translates for a caller holding parsed JSON:
    # String keys, already-nested objects, real Integers. A command line has
    # neither of those. It has `sequence.value=99` — one flat string, with the
    # nesting spelled as a path and the type not spelled at all.
    #
    # So this does the two things that turns into: rebuild the nesting, and
    # give every leaf the type the chapter declared for it.
    #
    # **The type comes from the projection, never from the value**. A door that
    # guessed — "99 looks like a number" — would send the Integer 99 for a
    # version string of "99", and be wrong in a way nothing downstream could
    # detect, because both are perfectly good arguments. `Projector::CliProjector`
    # already read the declared field type out of the value object; this only
    # applies it.

      # `tags.value=framework tags.value=model-checker` used to reach `bury`
      # twice and store the second one alone — no refusal, no warning, one tag
      # simply gone. That is the failure the interview named first: not the
      # loud kind, the kind where a value is forgotten and the caller has no
      # way to notice.
      #
      # **A list of one is still a list**. `tags.value=flaky` produces
      # `[{ value: "flaky" }]`, not `{ value: "flaky" }`, because the chapter
      # declared a collection and a caller who sent one element did not
      # thereby declare a different shape. The old behaviour handed a bare
      # object to a `list_of` attribute, and everything downstream that walks
      # it — a query's `contains`, a projection, the Postgres adapter's own
      # array handling — is entitled to assume it can iterate.
      #
      # Multi-field elements are not supported here, deliberately. A flat
      # command line has no way to say which `a.x=` goes with which `a.y=`,
      # and inventing an index syntax would be a language nobody asked for.

      # richer one is a job for `JsonDoor`, which has real nesting.
