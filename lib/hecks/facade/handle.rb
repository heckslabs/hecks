    # verbs through `method_missing`, closing over the dispatcher and the

    # one process each hand out handles bound to their own dispatcher.

      # collided with one of those — `Account::Freeze` -> `freeze`,
      # `ExternalTransfer::Send` -> `send` in the banking corpus, both real —
      # used to silently run the Kernel method instead of dispatching: no
      # error, no refusal, the call just did the wrong thing. Defining a
      # real singleton method per verb closed that; the `!` suffix (every
      # command, door and Handle alike) closes it a second, permanent way —
      # `freeze!`/`send!` name nothing Kernel/Object already answers to,

      # THE OTHER HALF OF A CROSS-REFERENCE. `transfer.source` already reads
      # the raw value — a plain reader, same as any other attribute, still
      # needed by a `given`. This is the hydrated hop docs/rails-integration.md
      # designed and marked "nothing built": `transfer.source_account`
      # resolves it to the actual Account record, on demand — nothing loads
      # until called, and this hop never triggers the next one. Plain
      # chaining composes for free from here : `payment.disputed_by_customer.name`
      # is two ordinary calls, each individually lazy, which is exactly why
      # this is a named accessor per reference rather than a `through:`
      # option — that shape was considered and rejected in the same design
      # note for hiding how many lookups actually happened behind one call.
      #
      # Defined BEFORE verb methods, not after — on the vanishing chance a
      # reference's own accessor name collided with a command's, the verb
      # should win; `initialize` calls this first so `define_verb_methods`
      # defines second and last.
      # NO DERIVATION LEFT (ADR 0025, "References"): `reference_to`
      # itself mints the bare attribute name now — `:account`, never
      # `:account_id` — so the accessor is spelled exactly like the
      # attribute it reads, with no `_id`-strip or `as:`-suffix rule to
      # apply first. `piece.account` (a METHOD, defined here) and
      # `piece[:account]` (`Handle#[]`, bracket access reading the raw
      # id straight off `@instance`) never collide despite sharing a
      # name — Ruby dispatches the two completely differently — which is
      # what makes the OLD "studio_studio" double-suffix workaround
      # (this method used to force a DIFFERENT name specifically to dodge
      # that non-collision) unnecessary rather than merely simplified.
