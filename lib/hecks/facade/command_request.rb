  module Facade
    # Turns an external command request into the dispatcher's receiver/payload
    # envelope. Human-facing doors may accept their old flat id spelling at
    # the edge, but every call leaving this boundary has one shape:
    #
    #   aggregate command: { to: "record-id", with: { declared: "facts" } }
    #   entity command:    { to: { aggregate: "...", entity: "..." },
    #                        with: { declared: "facts" } }
    #
    # The command interpreter remains the authority on which facts are
    # declared. This helper only prevents routing fields from leaking into the
    # fact payload and gives every external door the same wire contract.
