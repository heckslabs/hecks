module Hecks
  # THE BUS, NOT A DOOR — `docs/hecks-survey-what-we-wish-we-had.md` and
  # `docs/future-features.md` both name the sibling project's own
  # "Storehouse" the single highest-priority gap this repo had: "no
  # per-command tool... the bluebook IS the contract, the [door] just
  # projects it." This module IS that bus, borrowing its name too — the
  # dispatch/query/state/... surface below is a pure function of a
  # `Runtime::Dispatcher` plus plain Ruby arguments, no IO, no protocol
  # awareness. `bin/hecks_mcp_door` is ONE projection of it — MCP over
  # stdio — not the whole thing; a plain CLI door, an HTTP door, a second
  # transport of any shape, would sit beside it on the exact same bus,
  # sharing the same audit log and caller-identity handling, without
  # ever needing to speak MCP. (This module used to BE named `McpDoor`
  # and live under `Facade` — that conflated the bus with its one built
  # transport; this file is the rename, not a rewrite.)
  #
  #   catalog  — what aggregates a domain declares, and what each can do
  #   describe — one aggregate's full command/query/refusal contract
  #   validate — is this domain's wiring sound (deep: also model-checks it)
  #   domains  — every domain directory under a root, discovered not typed
  #   dispatch — issue a command (dry_run: preview, steps: batch)
  #   query    — ask a question
  #   state    — read what is actually stored, no verb involved
  #   events   — what HAPPENED, with payloads, to one record — not just its
  #              current state; events THIS BUS witnessed, sourced from
  #              its own audit log, not a full event-sourcing replay
  #   history  — the full append-only journal, not just current state
  #   behaviors — run a domain's hand-curated `.behaviors` examples
  #   follow   — tail this bus's own dispatch/query/state audit log
  #
  # `dispatch`/`query`/`state` EACH TAKE A `summary` — the survey's "every
  # audit row carries human intent for free" — and `dispatch`/`query`
  # additionally take an optional `source:` (`SOURCE_TAGS`, the survey's
  # `SourceTag`: who is calling) AND an optional `role:`/`actor_id:` —
  # a real caller identity, bound for the call's duration via `Hecks.
  # as_caller`, checked against a `role`-gated command's own declared
  # role (`CommandRules::Authorization`) rather than merely documented by
  # `describe`. `dispatch` REQUIRES it for any command that declares a
  # role — `require_caller_for_role_gated!` refuses an unbound dispatch
  # against one rather than silently running it unchecked; `query`'s own
  # authorization runs on a separate mechanism (`Runtime::TenantScope`)
  # that `role:` does not gate. This is self-asserted identity, not
  # authentication: the caller states its own `role`/`actor_id`, and this
  # bus checks it consistently once stated — see `bin/hecks_mcp_door`'s
  # header for what that does and does not guarantee. Every call through
  # those three, plus a dry run, is appended to a per-domain JSONL audit
  # log (`record!`) `follow` tails back — a record of what the caller
  # SAID it was, not independently verified identity. `catalog`/
  # `describe`/`validate`/`domains`/`history`/`behaviors`/`events` need
  # neither — they change nothing and commit nothing to any log.
  #
  # A CALLER HANDS IN AN ALREADY-BOOTED `runtime`, the same division of
  # labor `Facade::CliRunner` already keeps against `bin/run`: booting a
  # domain from a path is IO the calling `bin/` script owns, this stays a
  # pure function of a `Runtime::Dispatcher` plus plain Ruby arguments —
  # no different from `CliRunner.call(runtime:, argv:)` itself.
  # `validate` and `domains` are the two exceptions: `validate`'s whole
  # job is to attempt the boot and report whether it survived, so it
  # takes the domain PATH instead and boots it; `domains` has no
  # domain to be handed one of yet, that's what it's answering.
  #
  # NO NEW VOCABULARY otherwise. Every method here composes doors that
  # already exist — `Projector.call(:cli, ...)` for verb/question alias
  # resolution (the identical table `CliRunner` itself resolves against),
  # `Projector.call(:docs, ...)` for `describe`, `Facade::JsonDoor` for
  # the JSON↔Runtime::Value boundary, `Registry#repository` for `state`/
  # `history`, `Registry#verify!` (run by every boot) for `validate`,
  # `Bluebook::ModelCheck` for `validate(deep: true)`, `Hecks::Behaviors`
  # for `behaviors`, `Adapters::Folder#domain?` for `domains`,
  # `Dispatcher#dry_run?` for `dispatch(dry_run: true)`. A second copy of
  # any of these here would be the exact duplication `Facade::JsonDoor`'s
  # own header already warns against.

    # ZOOM LEVEL THREE — is the wiring sound at all: every bind names a
    # declared aggregate, every adapter satisfies the port it claims, the
    # default adapter is usable. `Registry#verify!` (`runtime/registry/
    # verification.rb`) is the one place this repo already answers that
    # question, and `Runtime::Loader.boot` already calls it as the last
    # step of every boot — so THIS is the one method here that boots for
    # itself rather than taking a `runtime:` already in hand, because a
    # runtime that successfully reached this line already answered the
    # question. Given a domain PATH, not a booted runtime, deliberately:
    # asking "is this valid" about a domain that failed to boot at all
    # has to be askable without a runtime to hand it.
    #
    # `deep: true` GOES PAST WIRING INTO LOGIC — `Bluebook::ModelCheck`,
    # the lightweight-formal-methods leg (dead lifecycle transitions, a
    # saga state no handler chain reaches, a dispatch to nowhere). Opt-in
    # and separate from the base check on purpose: a wiring defect is
    # "this cannot run at all", a model-check finding is "this runs, but
    # part of it can never fire" — two different questions, and the
    # first is far cheaper to ask on every boot.
    #
    # ANY BOOT FAILURE ANSWERS THE QUESTION, not only `WiringError` — a
    # domain path with no `.hecksagon`, a malformed bluebook, is just as
    # much "not valid" as a real wiring mismatch, and this tool exists
    # precisely so none of those ever cross a projection of this bus as
