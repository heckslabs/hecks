    # The trivial case, on purpose: canonical IR projected as canonical
    # IR. `Bluebook#to_h` already satisfies every §30 acceptance
    # criterion on its own — no live runtime needed to call it, output is
    # deterministic (the same golden fixtures `spec/ir_golden_spec.rb`
    # pins), and target-version metadata rides along for free (`§7`'s
    # `ir_version:` is the first key `to_h` emits). Registering it proves
    # the framework's call shape against a real, already-load-bearing
    # target before any genuinely new projector (`:rust`, `:ul`,
    # `:openid`) has to.
