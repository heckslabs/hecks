    # A BLUEBOOK, PROJECTED AS ITS OWN USAGE DOCUMENTATION.
    #
    # WHAT THIS IS FOR. A chapter in this corpus already contains everything a
    # user of it needs: what each aggregate is (`description`), what each verb
    # is for (`goal`) and who issues it (`role`), which states it moves
    # between, what it refuses and in whose words (`given`, `invariant`,
    # `ensures`), and what each list is worth reading (`description` on a
    # query). None of that reaches the person who has to CALL the domain.
    # They read the source, or they read a document somebody wrote beside the
    # source and stopped updating.
    #
    # `docs/implemented/reference/` is the precedent and the contrast. `bin/reference`
    # generates it from the language's own Syntax chapter, so the reference
    # for the DSL cannot drift from the DSL. This is the same trick one level
    # down: the usage document for a DOMAIN, generated from that domain, so it
    # cannot drift from the domain either.
    #
    # WHY IT IS A PROJECTION AND NOT A GENERATOR SCRIPT. `Projector` is the
    # repository's registry of "canonical IR in, external artifact out" (§30
    # of the implementation plan), and this is exactly that shape: one
    # bluebook's IR in, markdown out, no runtime needed and no store touched.
    # Registered as `:docs` beside `:ir`, and reachable the way every
    # projector is — `Projector.call(:docs, bluebook: ...)`.
    #
    # AND AS A METHOD, which is the half that makes it get used.
    # `Facade::Surface` already installs a module per chapter carrying
    # `vision` and `aggregates`; `docs` joins them, so a booted domain answers
    # `QualityControl.docs` and an aggregate door answers
    # `QualityControl::Bug.docs`. A document you have to remember a script for
    # is a document nobody reads.
    #
    # WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: invent. Every sentence below comes out
    # of the chapter. Where a chapter says nothing — an aggregate with no
    # `description`, a command with no `goal` — the document says nothing
    # rather than filling the gap with a restatement of the name, because a
    # generated paragraph that only rephrases an identifier teaches a reader
    # to skim the ones that do not.
