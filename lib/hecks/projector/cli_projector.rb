    # A BLUEBOOK, PROJECTED AS ITS OWN COMMAND-LINE SURFACE.
    #
    # Every verb a domain declares is a subcommand; every argument is an
    # option whose TYPE, whose admitted values and whose required-ness are
    # already stated in the chapter. A hand-written CLI restates all of it and
    # then drifts — and the first thing to drift is the help text, which is the
    # only part anybody reads.
    #
    # WHAT IS PROJECTED, AND WHAT IS NOT. This answers the SURFACE — the verb
    # tree, the argument spec, the usage text — and nothing executes here. One
    # small generic runner (`bin/run`) boots a domain, asks for this, parses
    # against it and dispatches.
    #
    # The alternative was generating an executable per domain, which is what
    # `bin/project_rust` does for a whole runtime and would be the more
    # spectacular version of this. It was not taken: a generated program is a
    # second copy of the dispatch logic, and it needs regenerating on every
    # bluebook edit — a second tax beside the era gate, paid for a file nobody
    # reads. Projecting the surface keeps one dispatcher and a help text that
    # cannot be stale, because it is computed at the moment it is printed.
    #
    # THE TYPING IS THE POINT. A CLI hands everything over as a String.
    # `sequence.value=99` has to become the Integer 99 or the runtime refuses
    # it, and the only honest place to learn that is the value object's own
    # declared field type. A CLI that guessed — "it looks like a number" —
    # would send 99 for a version string of "99" and be wrong in a way nobody
    # could see.

      # TWO NAMESPACES, NOT ONE — `{ verbs:, questions:, usage: }`.

      # A chapter may legally declare a command and a query of one name: the
      # language namespaces them and `Banking::Account.Open` is both, in the
      # corpus, today. A single flat list of subcommands has to pick one, and
      # picking silently is how `Ticket.Filed` sat undetected in this
      # repository for a day.
      #
      # So a question is asked with `ask`: `bin/run ask account.open`. It is
      # this codebase own word — `Query::AskOption`, "the ask" — it is
      # shell-safe where a `?` suffix would be eaten by globbing, and it makes
      # the collision impossible rather than detected. It also reads as what it
      # is: everything under `ask` changes nothing.
