    # A BLUEBOOK, PROJECTED AS PROSE AN SME CAN READ BACK AND CONFIRM.
    #
    # WHAT THIS IS FOR. `DocsProjector` already answers "what can I call and
    # what does it want" for the person implementing against a domain —
    # tables of arguments, shapes, refusal reasons. That is the wrong
    # register for the person who can actually say whether the domain is
    # RIGHT: the subject-matter expert who knows what an account is and has
    # never read a markdown table in their life. This projects the same IR
    # as sentences instead — "Debit — take money out. Issued by a Teller. It
    # only goes through if the balance covers it." — so a domain can be
    # read back to the person who can validate it without them learning the
    # DSL first.
    #
    # SAME SOURCE, SAME GUARANTEE `DocsProjector` gives: nothing here is
    # invented. Every sentence quotes a `description`, `goal`, or `given`
    # already declared in the chapter; where a chapter says nothing, this
    # says nothing rather than manufacturing a sentence out of an
    # identifier. Registered as `:narrate` beside `:docs`, same call shape
    # (`Projector.call(:narrate, bluebook: ...)`), same aggregate-scoping
    # via `options[:aggregate]`.
    #
    # WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: replace `DocsProjector`. A shape table still says
    # "id of a Customer" more precisely than any sentence would, and an
    # implementer still wants that. This is the other document the same IR
    # is owed — one written for the reader who is being asked "is this
    # right?", not "how do I call it?"
