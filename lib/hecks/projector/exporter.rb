      # a deployment happens to bind it to), and "is this aggregate bound
      # to a lineage-capable adapter" is exactly the kind of fact that
      # answer can change per-deployment without the bluebook's own shape
      # changing at all. Consumers that need it (bin/project_rust's own
      # `ir.json` sidecar, rust/host's runtime era-aware seed overlay —
      # dispatch.rs) merge this in as a SEPARATE top-level key, the same

      # inside it.
