    # `TenantScope`'s sibling — a hop folds to a synthetic `in`
    # where-clause the exact same way a tenant boundary folds to a
    # synthetic `eq` one, so every engine that already reads `.wheres`
    # answers a hop for free, with no per-engine code and no way for
    # one engine to forget it.
    #
    # A hop's own filtering never happens here — RESOLVING one hop
    # means running one ordinary, adapter-agnostic query against the
    # hop's TARGET aggregate (through the same Ports::Query boundary
    # any other query goes through), and folding the ids it answers
    # back in as a local membership check. A multi-hop chain resolves
    # from the FAR END inward: `fold` only ever peels off the head hop
    # (QuerySpecification::HopPath.next_hop, the one-step primitive),
    # and hands everything still left in the tail to a recursive
    # `apply` call — so hop 2, hop 3, and so on each get resolved by
    # their own ordinary query against their own target, one recursion
    # level at a time, never by this module trying to see the whole
    # chain at once. It terminates because each recursion is over a
    # strictly shorter dotted string, and
    # BluebookBuilder#validate_query_hops! already refused any chain
    # deep enough to matter before this ever runs.
