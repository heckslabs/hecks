        # The keys that are legitimately not attributes are the ones that address
        # the aggregate rather than describe it : `id`, whatever the aggregate is

        # actually belongs to (`Handler.Dispatch.Bind` is two hops), and each
        # hop's own `identity_heads` is addressing the same way the root's
        # are — `element_of` (entity_element.rb) reads them straight out of
        # `args` to find the element, never as a fact the command itself

        # `name is a PersonName — pass its fields as an object`, which describes a
        # mistake the caller did not make. The real mistake — an argument simply
        # missing — was never the one named, and nothing refused it on purpose.
        #
        # No command attribute anywhere in the corpus carries a default — checked,

        # `aggregate:` — present only for a port operation. An aggregate
        # command's own self-address never reaches this list at all

        # attribute to be absent) — but `PortOperationBuilder#reference_to`
        # always mints one (this file's own header on `PortOperation`: "no
        # creates?/acts_on distinction to protect"), because an operation
        # historically had no other way to say which record it addressed.
        # `to:` is that other way now (`Dispatcher#port_invocation`
        # promotes the identity attribute's own value out of the payload
        # and into routing) — which left the attribute still declared,
        # still non-optional, and now never present in `args` at all: every
        # operation with an identity attribute refused its own well-formed
        # calls, dispatched exactly the way `to:` intends. Exempted here on
