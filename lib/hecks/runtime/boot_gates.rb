module Hecks
  module Runtime
    # A boot's own small set of phase-tagged, conditionally-present gates —
    # ADR 0031. Registration is instance-scoped, one per `Loader.boot`
    # call, never a module-level singleton: a process that boots more than
    # one registry in its lifetime (every spec suite does) must never let
    # one boot's capability profile leak into the next boot's gate list.
    #
    # A gate is anything `.call(registry, directory)`-able — an existing
    # module method handed over as a `Method` object (`EraCheck.method
    # (:check_lineage!)`) needs no wrapper; a bare block does. Phases run
    # in the order `run!` is called, gates within a phase in registration
    # order — today exactly one gate per phase, so ordering among
    # same-phase gates has never been exercised.
    #
    # This is deliberately not the same registry `Hecks::Projector` uses
    # (ADR 0027) — that one is a process-wide, static IR-in/artifact-out
    # registry with no bindings and no live-state mutation; this one is
    # per-boot and gates real I/O (a Postgres mint, a saga-store read).
    # Sharing a primitive between them is deferred until a third consumer
    # actually wants it (0031's own Rejected Alternatives).
