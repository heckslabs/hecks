module Hecks
  module Runtime
    # Who is dispatching, bound for the duration of a block — the ambient
    # counterpart to `Runtime.with_registry`, but `Thread.current`-backed
    # rather than a plain module ivar: registry-binding happens at boot
    # time (single-threaded by construction), this happens at dispatch
    # time, which a future per-request caller (docs/rails-integration.md's
    # still-unbuilt `WebDoor`) needs to bind safely under concurrency.
    #
    # A child `Thread.new` spawned mid-block does not inherit this — plain
    # Ruby thread-local semantics — but nothing in this codebase spawns a
    # worker thread mid-dispatch today, so this is a fact worth naming
    # rather than a gap worth solving.
    module Caller
      # `actor_id` is optional, on top of the role that has always been
      # here — a caller that states only a role (every caller before this)
      # is checked the way it always was, string equality against the
      # command's own `role`. A caller that also names who it is lets
      # `CommandRules::Authorization` check a real Governance
      # `RoleAssignment` instead, once the command's domain has Governance
      # attached — see that module's own header for the full split.
      #
      # `as_of` and `scope` are both optional too, and both self-asserted
      # by the caller rather than derived from the command — deliberately:
      # `as_of` is filled at the door from `Ports::Clock.now`, never
      # inside the interpreter (see `Ports::Clock`'s own header), so
      # there is no other place to source it from. `scope` stays here
      # rather than becoming a command-level DSL construct on purpose —
      # a scope check that lived in the bluebook would put an
      # authorization concern inside the domain declaration itself; this
      # keeps it an application-boundary fact instead, the same shape
      # `role`/`actor_id` already are. The tradeoff: a caller states what
      # scope it is acting in, and `holds_role?` verifies a live grant
      # exists for that scope — it does not independently confirm the
      # scope matches whatever the command's own target data belongs to.
