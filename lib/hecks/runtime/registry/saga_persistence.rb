      # durability, its sagas use the same one, automatically: three
      # OPTIONAL adapter methods (`save_saga`/`delete_saga`/`each_saga`),
      # `respond_to?`-checked the same way `Ports::Persistence::AppendOnly`
      # already treats an adapter's own optional methods
      # (`find`/`all`/`count`/`reset!`/`events`/`record_event`).

        # Resolved and memoized per domain — the FIRST real aggregate
        # declared in the domain's own bluebook is the resolution
        # anchor. `Ports::Persistence::BindingPolicy.resolve` for that
        # aggregate already falls back to a domain-level default bind
        # (§0's `Hecksagon#bind_for`) before falling back to Memory, so
        # this needs no separate "was a default declared" branch of its
        # own — whatever adapter that anchor resolves to already IS the
        # domain's own default in the normal case (every aggregate
        # shares one adapter), and is the honest, documented fallback
        # for the rarer domain genuinely split across more than one
        # local adapter with no default declared.

        # GENUINELY LAZY, GENUINELY POST-BOOT — unlike `rehydrate_sagas!`
        # below (boot-only), this is called from live dispatch
        # (`SagaInterpreter#checkpoint`/`#end_saga`, on every saga
        # transition), so the FIRST call for a given domain can come from
        # any dispatching thread, not just the boot thread. `@saga_persistence`
        # itself is a plain Hash stood up once in `Registry#initialize` (no
        # race on the container), but `resolve_saga_persistence` is real work
        # (a `BindingPolicy.resolve` plus a lazy `repository` build) whose
        # RESULT — the actual adapter instance a domain's sagas persist
        # through — must be the SAME object for every caller: two threads
        # racing the first lookup and each building their own adapter would
        # silently split one domain's saga writes across two adapter
        # instances (worse than `Dispatcher#reaction_depth`'s M20 — that bug
        # corrupted a counter; this one can corrupt WHICH STORE a saga's
        # state lands in). Double-checked locking against a DEDICATED mutex
        # — never `@saga_mutex` — see `Registry#initialize`'s own comment for
        # why reusing that one would deadlock.

        # call site in this capability never needs one. Called once at
        # boot (`Loader.boot`, between `verify!` and dispatcher
