    # Which ports a boot can actually fulfill, read off the registry it already
    # holds. `registry.ports` names every port a domain declared a dependency
    # on ; `registry.adapters` names every adapter wired to implement one — the
    # same `adapter.port == port.name` match `Ports::Extraction` and
    # `Ports::IdentityGeneration` already make for themselves, one at a time,
    # each time they resolve. This is that same question asked once, for
    # every port at once, so a gap in the wiring is something a caller can ask
    # about rather than something a live dispatch discovers by refusing.
    #
    # `cycles` answers `[]`, always, and honestly: nothing in this port model
    # lets one port depend on another — a port names a verb and a signal, an
    # adapter names the port it implements, and neither can point at a third
    # port. There is no edge for a cycle to be made of.
