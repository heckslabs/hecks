    # **The scalar an identity path names**.
    #
    # An identity is declared as a path — `identified_by :number` — and
    # this is the one place that reads one. It follows the path and nothing else.
    #
    # What it replaced was `Value.identifier`, which opened a one-field value
    # object and took whatever was inside : that let `identified_by :number` pass
    # for an identity, with the runtime guessing which field had been meant. The
    # guess is gone. A declaration that names no field is now refused when the
    # bluebook loads (`an aggregate that is identified names a field`, `an entity
    # is known by a field`), so by the time anything is dispatched there is
    # always a path here to follow.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   Identity.scalar("number.value", account_number_value_object)  # => "acct-1"
