    # ONE ENTITY ELEMENT, LOCATED AND MUTATED — the walk-and-write half of
    # dispatching into a piece an aggregate holds, factored out of
    # `EntityInterpreter` so a SECOND caller (`CommandInterpreter`'s own
    # `delegate_to_entity` step) can locate and mutate the SAME element the
    # same way, against an aggregate record it already holds in memory
    # rather than one freshly loaded from a repository. `EntityInterpreter`
    # keeps its own dispatch order and Context; this is the part underneath
    # that both now share, so it exists in exactly one place rather than two
    # that could only ever drift (the same reasoning `Runtime::Identity`'s
    # own header gives for the join/dig/reading trio it centralizes).
    #
    # `rules` (a `CommandRules` instance) is passed explicitly throughout
    # rather than closed over, since this module has no instance of its own
    # to hold one.

      # ONE HOP PER CHAIN ENTRY. `container` starts as `instance` (the root
      # aggregate record) and becomes each just-located element in turn —
      # Dispatch's own element is found INSIDE the Handler element
      # `locate_chain` located the step before, never inside `instance`
      # directly. `owner` is whichever construct's OWN attribute declares
      # the list being searched (Handler declares `dispatches` ; the root
      # aggregate declares `handlers`) — `root_aggregate` stays the ROOT
      # the whole way through instead, passed to `element_of` separately,
      # because coercion (`Value.for_attribute`) resolves value objects
      # against the root's own namespace only ; an entity must never
      # answer `.value_object` (Entity's own header comment) so handing
      # it an intermediate owner instead would break every VO-typed
      # identity field a nested entity declares.
      #
      # `route`, if given, is the routing envelope's own entity chain
      # (`ctx.route.entities`, one entry per hop) — the routing/payload
      # split's own consequence: an entity's own identity may arrive via
      # `to:` rather than duplicated into `args`, so each hop is offered
      # its routed identity ahead of falling back to `args`.

      # part has to agree with the stored one. `routed_identity`, when given,

      # (`element_identity`, below) — the routing envelope already resolved
      # which element it means, so re-deriving `wants` from `args` would be
      # redundant at best and wrong if `args` no longer carries that identity
