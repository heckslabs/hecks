    # comparison (`Evaluator.comparison_detail`'s own comment has the full
    # scoping); nil otherwise. Deliberately not folded into `#message`:
    # that string is pinned byte-for-byte across this corpus's own specs
    # (`raise_error(GivenNotMet, "...")`, command_rules_spec.rb and every
    # domain that vendors this gem) as contract, so changing its shape by
    # default would be a breaking change for every one of them. Riding on
    # `#detailed_message` instead (Ruby 3.2+, what irb/a Rails console's
    # own unhandled-exception banner already calls to show more than
    # `#message`) means the detail actually reaches a human staring at a

    # evaluate against a value nobody wrote, which is the same silent-
    # wrong-answer class as an unpopulated projection reading "not
    # active" (ADR 0025, "Added attributes and absence"). An optional
    # attribute in the same spot reads nil instead — that is what

    # nil-read it sits beside, not a replacement for it.

    # rebuild sweep has populated yet, read by a `given`/`ensures`/
    # `invariant` as though it carried a real value. `GuardState` is
    # the one place this is raised, the same way AttributeAbsent is —
    # a declared field the record does not yet carry, distinguished
    # from that one only in why: an ordinary attribute is absent
    # because nobody backfilled it, a projected field is absent
    # because nobody has swept it yet.

    # (`AppendOnly#save`'s `expected_version:`) finds the stored version has
    # moved since this instance was read — someone else's write committed
    # in between. `CommandInterpreter#call`/`EntityInterpreter#call` catch
    # this themselves and retry the whole dispatch from a fresh hydrate, so
    # `enforce_givens` re-evaluates against the now-current state; a caller
    # only ever sees this escape when every retry is exhausted under
    # sustained contention — an operational condition (many concurrent
    # writers hammering one aggregate), not a business rule a domain author
    # declared. See docs/decisions/ (concurrency-control ADR).

    # A Lambda-routed domain's own refusal (rust/host, `Runtime::
    # RemoteDispatcher`), carrying Rust's own refusal text verbatim —
    # not yet mapped back to the specific matching class above
    # (GivenNotMet vs. EnsuresNotMet vs. ...), a real, known,
    # documented gap: the WASM projector's own event/refusal-wording
    # parity work (ADR 0021) makes the text match Ruby's, but nothing
    # yet parses that text back into a typed Ruby exception the way a
    # local dispatch already raises one directly. Callers that only
    # need "the domain said no" (not which specific rule) are
    # unaffected; callers pattern-matching a specific refusal class
    # against a Lambda-routed domain are the ones this gap would bite.

    # The domain saying no — the errors a reaction may legitimately meet and
    # record as an undelivered outcome. A policy whose target refuses is a fact
    # about the domain ; the originating command still stands.
    #
    # Everything else is a defect : a NoMethodError in an interpreter, a
    # NameError from a missing constant, a TypeError from a bad assumption. A
    # blanket `rescue StandardError` used to fold both into one line —
    # `delivered: false, reason: "..."` — so a crash in the runtime was
    # indistinguishable from a rule doing its job, and read as normal operation
    # in the log.
    #
    # UnknownVerb is one of these, and deliberately : a cross-domain policy
    # (`across "Notifications"`) fires in deployments where that domain is not
    # loaded, and recording the undelivered reaction rather than raising is the
    # design — spec/policy_spec states it in so many words, "records a reaction
    # it cannot deliver rather than swallowing it".
    # InvariantViolation belongs here and was missing. A value object refusing
    # its own rule is the domain saying no as plainly as a given is — but the
    # class is declared over in value.rb and never made the list, so the policy
    # and saga interpreters, which rescue exactly these, would let it propagate
    # as though the runtime had broken. A reaction whose target violates an
    # invariant is declined, not crashed. Found by spec/domain_refusal_spec on
    # its first run : every corpus refusal must be a class named here, and 23
    # of banking's were InvariantViolation.
    # The names come from the language, the classes from this module.
    # `DomainRefusal` declares which refusals are the domain's own —
    # a rule the caller broke — as against a runtime fault. Resolving
    # each name here means a refusal declared but never defined fails
    # at load with a NameError, rather than being quietly absent from
    # a list nothing re-checks.
