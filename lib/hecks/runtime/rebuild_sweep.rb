    # The out-of-band half of `projects` (S12, ADR 0025 — "Consistency
    # across aggregate boundaries"). A projected field is never written
    # by the command that reads it — nothing at dispatch time takes a
    # live cross-aggregate read the way `CommandRules::References
    # #dereference` still does — so this is the one place a projected
    # field's value actually gets copied over: walk every record of the
    # owning aggregate, resolve each of its own `projected_fields`
    # through the reference it names, and `save` the local copy.
    #
    # **Explicit and callable, not automatic** — no on-boot detection of a
    # freshly-declared `projects` with no held-era precedent, no
    # generated `Policy#for_each` reaction keeping it live in real
    # time as the target changes. Both are real extensions this same
    # ADR section describes; both are deliberately deferred. This is
    # the mechanism a caller reaches for by hand — `bin/rebuild
    # Domain::Aggregate`, a scheduled job, whatever the deployment
    # needs — proven to work end to end before either automatic
    # trigger is built on top of it.
    #
    # **Needs no new adapter capability**. `find`/`all`/`save` are the same
    # three primitives every real adapter already answers identically
    # (`Ports::Persistence::AppendOnly#save` — append, then project,
    # the same for Memory/Postgres/SQLite/D1/Heki) — confirmed by
    # direct reading before this was built, not assumed.

      # record it holds. Returns how many records actually changed —

      # moved on the target side touches the append log not at all.
