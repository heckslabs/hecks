          # argument_gate.rb names the old payload-only lookup "the weakest
          # part of the gate" : a correlation key arriving on a command only
          # because `correlation_keys` widens the undeclared-argument
          # allow-list domain-wide. This is the additive fix — a leg that
          # carries nothing correlation-shaped at all still correlates,
          # because the saga that dispatched it already knows the answer.
          # Keyed by `correlation_head`

          # own emitting record's identity — `event.id`, not a field dug back
          # out of the payload. This used to read `event.payload[own_key]`
          # (`own_key` the aggregate's own reference-key convention, "wire",
          # "transfer"), which only ever held a value because LEGACY dispatch
          # left the self-addressing key riding along in the payload
          # unfiltered. Routing separated from payload (`to:`/`with:`, the
          # facade's own `Handle#run` always uses it) closed exactly that
          # leak — correctly, since an addressing key is not a fact the
          # payload should carry — which left this tier reading an empty
          # Hash for any self-referencing leg with no OTHER declared
          # attributes (`OnboardingCase.Clear`, `.Decline` — no `attribute`
          # lines at all): the saga silently stopped advancing, forever, for
          # exactly the leg this tier exists to correlate.
          #
          # `event.id` says the identical thing this tier always meant —
          # "the record that just emitted this event, by its own identity" —
          # and unlike a payload dig it is populated by the record itself,
          # not by which dispatch convention the caller happened to use.
          #
          # GATED, still — a manually-dispatched command on a wholly
          # UNRELATED aggregate can share an event NAME this process_manager happens to
          # handle (`Drawer.Take` also emits "Taken", the same name a
          # SAGA-DISPATCHED leg uses) with nothing this saga should read as
          # its own conversation. What makes a leg genuinely
          # self-referencing — the one fact worth trusting `event.id`
          # for — is that `correlates_by`'s own head field IS this event's
          # OWN aggregate's declared identity, not merely a same-shaped
          # name: `OnboardingCase.identity_heads` really does include
          # `:reference`, `correlates_by :"reference.value"`'s own head ;
          # `Drawer.identity_heads` is `[:number]`, nowhere close.
