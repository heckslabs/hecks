      # THE ROOT-FIRST FIX'S OWN FIX — root-first alone only reaches one
      # level: it guarantees the root is in `projected` before any other
      # head is matched, but a CHAIN of non-root heads (a head that
      # references another non-root head, not the root) is still
      # matched against whatever declaration order happened to put in
      # `projected` so far. `include Coupon` before `include Promotion`
      # on a read model rooted at Item, where Coupon references
      # Promotion (which references Item), silently returned an empty
      # `coupons` array — Coupon's match ran while `projected` held only
      # Item, one level short of what it needed.
      #
      # Fixed the same way root-first was: not by asking bluebook authors
      # to declare `include` in dependency order (the same promise
      # `read_model_builder.rb` already makes and this file is the one
      # place obligated to keep), but by topologically sorting the
      # non-root heads on their OWN declared reference fields before
      # this method's runtime matching ever runs — Kahn's algorithm,
      # picking ready heads in DECLARED order at each step so declaring
      # order still governs whenever there is no dependency to break a
      # tie. This generalizes root-first (a chain of length 1) to a
      # chain of any depth, and to a head depending on more than one
      # other head at once (not just a straight chain).
      #
      # A cycle among non-root heads (A references B which references A)
      # has no valid topological order at all — falls back to the
      # remaining heads' declared order rather than looping forever, the
      # same "whichever runs first finds nothing" behaviour this method
      # had for every non-root head before root-first existed.
