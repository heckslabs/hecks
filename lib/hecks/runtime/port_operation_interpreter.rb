    # a trimmed CommandInterpreter: the same payload gate and coercion
    # (ArgumentGate, Interpreting#normalize_args), but no `given`, no
    # `mutations`, no lifecycle, no save. A port operation does not act on an
    # aggregate instance — it translates an external call into an event in
    # this domain's own vocabulary, and whatever mutation follows happens
    # wherever a `policy` reacts to that event, exactly as it would for any
    # command-emitted one.

      # The domain calling out, and both endings recorded.
      #
      # The adapter is found the same way every other port's is — by name,
      # across whatever adapters this boot loaded — so an `asks` is bound by
      # an adapter declaring `port "IssueTracker"` and nothing new to learn.
      #
      # Every failure is an answer. A raise from the far side of a boundary is
      # not an exception in this domain's terms, it is the outside saying no,
      # and the chapter already named the word for that. So the rescue is
      # deliberately wide: a timeout, a bad credential, an adapter that does
      # not exist, a nil where a number was wanted — all of them become the
      # `refuses` event, carrying what was said. A policy reacts to it, a
      # retry counter reads it, and nothing has to catch anything.
      #
      # An ask is handed the record it is about.
      #
      # An inbound operation deliberately cannot read state — it is the
      # anti-corruption boundary, translating a fact from outside, and letting
      # it read the aggregate would make it a second place rules live. That
      # rule was written for that direction and does not survive the crossing.
      #
      # An outbound one almost always needs the record. `asks "File"` names
      # `reference_to Ticket` and the adapter needs the ticket's repository,
      # title and body — which are on the ticket, and which the policy that
      # triggered this cannot supply because a command's event payload is its
      # arguments, not its state. Without this, every ask would have to have
      # its data re-passed through the command that fired it, so the same text
      # would live in two places and could differ.
      #
      # Arguments win over state, because an argument is what this call said
      # and state is what the record happens to hold.

      # The answer is spread, not nested — and that is what makes the loop
      # close. A policy re-enters its target with the event payload verbatim;
      # it cannot reach inside a key. So an answer tucked under `answered:`
      # can be read by a human and by nothing else, and the command that
      # should record the issue number never gets one.
      #
      # Spread, the adapter's own keys are the arguments of whatever command
      # reacts to the answering event. Which is a real contract on the adapter
      # — it must return what that command takes, in the shape the runtime
      # coerces (`{ number: { value: 43 } }`, not `43`) — and naming it here
      # is cheaper than a mapping layer nobody could see into.
      #
