      # WAVE 8 (equivalence-gap plan, item 1.6) — NOT done, and this
      # comment now says precisely how far it got, corrected from an
      # EARLIER version of itself that briefly (same PR, never released)
      # claimed the inventory was empty and deleted this method outright.
      # A full corpus audit (`DependencyPlanning::Analyzer.call` against
      # every `creates?`-true command in all 5 EXAMPLE domains — banking,
      # pizzas, chess, compliance, roster) found and fixed 4 real
      # authoring bugs (`Statement.Generate`, `CreatePizza`, `Chess::
      # Game.Start`, `Roster.Open` — each declared an attribute and
      # never `sets` it, so the field silently stayed nil on every
      # created record regardless of what a caller sent), plus a real
      # `DependencyPlanning::Analyzer` bug for ENTITY-owned commands
      # (`root_aggregate:`, that class's own header) that surfaced one
      # more live corpus bug of its own (`payment_cards.bluebook`'s own
      # `Withdrawal.Dispute`, which never actually checked whether the
      # card was retired) — all real, all kept.
      #
      # DELETING THIS METHOD ON THAT BASIS TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG,
      # caught by running the full suite rather than trusting the
      # audit's own scope: the 5 example domains are nowhere near the
      # WHOLE inventory of `creates?`-true commands this fallback
      # actually carries. Dozens of separate, purpose-built spec
      # fixtures across the suite (`spec/fixtures/*.bluebook`, and
      # inline `Hecks.bluebook` blocks declared directly inside
      # individual spec files — governance, mutation ops, ports,
      # routing, tenant isolation, sagas, and more) declare their OWN
      # small `creates?`-true commands the same incomplete way, and
      # rely on this exact fallback to create anything at all. Deleting
      # it produced 218 failures across specs with nothing to do with
      # Wave 8's own subject — confirmed, not guessed, by actually
      # running `bundle exec rspec` after the deletion, not merely by
      # extrapolating from the one audited inventory. `spec/fixtures/
      # till.bluebook`'s own `Till.OpenTill` (missing `sets :number`,
      # the identical bug shape as the 4 fixed above) was fixed
      # alongside the four real corpus ones as one instance of this — but
      # it was one of many, not the last one, and finding the rest is
      # real, separate, much larger follow-up work this pass does not
      # attempt: a suite-wide audit of every declared bluebook fixture,
      # not just the 5 example domains the plan's own text named.
      #
      # Transitional compatibility for live source that has not yet
      # acquired explicit effects, same as it always was — deliberately
      # isolated from the normal routing and planning path so
      # `reference_to` no longer chooses how a migrated command hydrates
      # or persists. A real, future Wave 8 removes this once THAT wider
      # inventory is empty, not before.
      #
      # `ctx.plan.complete_state?` already claimed every command whose
      # plan is fully resolved in the two branches above `step_hydrate`
      # tries first, so reaching this check already means the plan is
      # incomplete — an un-migrated command still routes here on
      # `creates?` alone, the same as the old `hydrate` did, regardless
      # of whether it happens to have any mutations (`write_set`).
      # Requiring an EMPTY write_set here refused every un-migrated
      # creating command that sets even one field.
