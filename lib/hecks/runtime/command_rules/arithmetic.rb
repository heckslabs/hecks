        # and `to: "sold"`, never a Symbol meant as a value.
        #
        # `&& args.key?(source)` used to guard the lookup, and that guard is what
        # made an ABSENT argument fall through to `source` and return THE SYMBOL
        # ITSELF as the value. `Customer.Register` without its `name` set name to
        # the literal `:name`, coercion met a Symbol where a PersonName belonged,
        # and the refusal read "name is a PersonName — pass its fields as an
        # object, not :name" — a message describing a mistake the caller had not

        # true` existed (`CommandBuilder#attribute_impl`,
        # `attribute_collector.rb`): `sets` already sources correctly from
        # an optional attribute, resolving absent to nil exactly as this
        # method does, and REFUSING it here would be wrong, not merely
        # undone work — `TillRoom::Till.TakeIn`'s own `note` (spec/
        # fixtures/till.bluebook) and Banking's `CardPayment.Authorize`'s
        # `tags` (payment_cards.bluebook) are real, live commands whose
        # `sets` mutation is deliberately sourced from an optional
        # attribute the caller may omit — `spec/runtime/command_rules_spec
        # .rb`'s own "says an absent OPTIONAL argument is nil, not the
        # name of the argument" pins exactly this as correct, not pending.
        # The meta-domain's own self-hosted commands (Command.Declare's
        # `role`/`goal`/`provenance`/`from`/`position`, and ~35 more sites
        # across the language) all lean on the identical pattern — nil is
        # the RIGHT answer for a `sets` sourced from a declared-optional
        # attribute the caller left out, every time.
        #
        # The one thing that WAS still a real, narrow gap — a `sets`
        # source Symbol naming NOTHING the command declares at all (a
        # typo, not an optional argument) — silently resolved to nil
        # forever the same way, indistinguishable at either build or run
        # time from a legitimate optional absence. Closed at BUILD time
        # instead of here: `CommandBuilder#refuse_unknown_argument_sources!`
        # refuses it the moment the `.bluebook` file loads, mirroring
        # `AggregateBuilder#seal_query_argument`'s identical check for a
        # query's own where-clause argument. This function stays exactly
        # what it always was — a pure, unconditional lookup — because by
        # the time ANY mutation reaches it, the source has already been
