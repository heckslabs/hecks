    # The two directions between a flat, dotted, all-strings web payload
    # (`{"amount.cents"=>"1050", "amount.currency"=>"USD"}`, whether it came
    # off a POST form body or a GET query string — Rack hands back the same
    # flat shape for both as long as nothing uses `[]` bracket names) and the
    # nested, typed hash `Dispatcher#dispatch`/`#query` actually take
    # (`{amount: {cents: 1050, currency: "USD"}}`).
    #
    # `extract` needs the Field tree, not just the raw params — a numeric
    # leaf's own runtime check (`Value::Coercion#check_numeric_fields`)
    # requires an actual `Integer`/`Float`, not a String that merely looks
    # like one (`given.is_a?(expected)`, no coercion attempted there); a web
    # form can only ever hand back strings, so the cast has to happen here,
    # once, using the same shape `FieldShape` already resolved for
    # rendering the input in the first place — one reading of the IR, not
    # two that could disagree.
    module Params
      # Every leaf field carries its own full dotted path regardless of how
      # deep `FieldShape` nested it to get there — a single-attribute value
      # object unwraps to a leaf sitting at the top of the fields array with
      # a two-segment path (`"reference.value"`), the exact same shape a
      # `:group`'s own child carries. So this collects every leaf as
      # (full path -> value) first, and nests by the path's own segments
      # last — one nesting rule, blind to how a field arrived at its path.

      # the same result hash. Depending on which pair `each_with_object`
      # reaches first, the naive walk below used to fail in one of two
      # ways: a scalar planted first left `acc[segment] ||= {}` seeing a
      # truthy non-Hash and reusing it as `node`, so the next `node[leaf] =
      # value` blew up with a raw `TypeError` from calling `String#[]=`
      # with a Symbol key; a scalar planted after the nested group instead
      # sailed through `node[leaf] = value` and silently clobbered the
      # entire nested hash with the scalar, losing every sibling under it
      # with no error at all. Both directions are checked explicitly here
      # so either order raises the same clear `ArgumentError` instead of a
      # confusing crash or silent data loss — this is the family of error
