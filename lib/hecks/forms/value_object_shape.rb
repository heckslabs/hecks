    # renderer, a separate app, not this repo), and
    # `adapters/driven/sql_query_builder.rb` (a query's own ORDER BY/
    # where compiler) each grew their own copy of "is this VO money-
    # shaped," "does it have exactly one attribute, worth unwrapping,"
    # and "which member of it is numeric" — the same three questions,
    # answered identically by definition (a VO's shape doesn't change
    # depending on who's asking), so a fix to one copy was never
    # guaranteed to reach the others.
