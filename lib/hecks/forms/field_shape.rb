    # `"email.address"`, `"amount.cents"` — the same convention the language
    # already uses for a query's own cross-object `where` clauses
    # (`where(:"customer.status" => ...)`), not a fresh one invented here. A
    # command receives its arguments as nested hashes

    # this same dotted spelling back apart on submit — one convention, two
    # directions.
