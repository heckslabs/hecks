    # `id` plus its state hash. `Runtime::Instance` already answers both,
    # so `repository.all`'s own records pass straight through; a query's
    # answer does not (`QueryInterpreter#call` flattens `{id:}.merge(state)`
    # into one hash with no method to call — see
    # docs/command-form-and-query-form-bluebook.md's note on why), so
    # app.rb wraps those results in one of these before they ever reach a
    # renderer, and every renderer here only has to know one shape.

    # An array of Record (or anything answering `#id`/`#state` — a
    # Runtime::Instance qualifies without wrapping) -> an HTML table.
    # Shared by the aggregate index page (record_renderer.rb) and a
    # query's own results (query_form_renderer.rb) — the same records
    # read the same columns either way.
