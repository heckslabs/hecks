    # Hand-rolled, on purpose — the repo has no ERB anywhere and no template
    # engine dependency (see docs/command-form-and-query-form-bluebook.md's survey). Every
    # other generator in this codebase (bin/reference's markdown, the IR's own
    # `to_h`) builds output as plain Ruby strings; this does the same for HTML,
    # with exactly one job: nothing that reaches `Escape.html` ever becomes a
    # tag. A feature developer's own domain data — a customer's name, an
    # account number a support rep typed into a form and got wrong — flows
    # through here on every render, so escaping is not optional decoration.
    module Escape
      # Order matters — `&` first, or every escape this method itself just
      # wrote (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, ...) gets re-escaped a second time.
      def self.html(value)
        value.to_s

      # Safe inside a double-quoted HTML attribute specifically — `html`
      # already covers this (it escapes `"`), kept as a named alias so a
      # call site reads "this value fills an attribute" rather than repeating
      # the same escaping and leaving the reader to check they match.
      def self.attr(value) = html(value)

      # L12 (docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md) — safe as a
      # query-string VALUE. `html`/`attr` guard against the value becoming
      # markup, but say nothing about it staying inside the URL syntax
      # position it was placed in: an aggregate's identity is free-form
      # unless its value object declares a `pattern:` (see S3 in the same
      # audit), so `&`, `+`, `?`, `#`, and `/` are all otherwise legal id
      # characters, and each would corrupt an href/Location built by naive
      # interpolation (a stray `&` smuggles a second query parameter, `#`
      # truncates the path at a fragment, `/` splits the path into an
      # extra segment, ...). Percent-encodes via
      # `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (`+` for space) — correct ONLY
      # for a query-string value (query_form_renderer.rb's `quick_links`,
      # record_renderer.rb's `?to=`). For a URL PATH segment use `path`
      # below instead — `+` is a literal plus there, not an escaped space,
      # so this method would corrupt any id containing a space. Callers
      # still wrap the ASSEMBLED href/Location in `attr` (or `html`) as
      # usual — this only covers the id's own component, not the
      # surrounding markup.
      def self.url(value) = URI.encode_www_form_component(value.to_s)

      # Same guard as `url`, for a URL PATH segment instead of a
      # query-string value. `encode_www_form_component` renders space as
      # `+`, which is only meaningful inside a query string — in a path
      # segment `+` is a literal plus, so an id like "John Smith" would
      # round-trip to "John+Smith" and 404 against the real id "John
      # Smith". Reuse the same percent-encoding and just correct that one
      # character back to `%20`.
      def self.path(value) = URI.encode_www_form_component(value.to_s).gsub("+", "%20")
    end

    # A tiny attribute-hash -> string helper, shared by every renderer in
    # this directory so `<input ...>` doesn't get hand-assembled five
    # different ways with five different escaping bugs waiting in each.
    # `true` renders as a bare boolean attribute (`required`, not
    # `required="true"`); `nil`/`false` are dropped entirely.
