      # FLAGS `hash[new] = hash.delete(old)` INSIDE A LOOP — a method that
      # both READS and WRITES the same hash across a loop's iterations,
      # in the specific rename/permutation shape this codebase has
      # already lost real data to once.
      #
      # THE BUG THIS IS THE MECHANICAL FOLLOW-UP TO (M27,
      # docs/audits/2026-08-10-main-bug-audit.md,
      # docs/audits/2026-08-11-bug-triage.md; fixed in
      # `Hecks::Ports::Persistence::Lineage#apply_renames`,
      # lib/hecks/ports/persistence/plugins/era/lineage.rb): a rename
      # rule set applied one rule at a time, `state[new_name] =
      # state.delete(old_name)` per rule, against the SAME hash it was
      # reading from — so a swap (`rename :a, to: :b` alongside `rename
      # :b, to: :a`) on `{a: 1, b: 2}` collapsed to `{a: 1}`. The first
      # rule wrote `b: 1` (clobbering the real `b: 2`) before the second
      # rule ever got a chance to read the value that was supposed to
      # move to `:a` — sequential edits stepping on each other, not the
      # simultaneous permutation a rename set actually means. The same
      # shape loses data identically for ANY chain longer than one link
      # (`a->b->c->a`), not just a two-element swap.
      #
      # THE FIX THIS COP POINTS AT — snapshot every old key's value
      # FIRST, delete all old keys, THEN write all new keys, so no
      # rename in the pass ever reads a key this same pass has already
      # written:
      #
      #   snapshot = renames.filter_map { |old_name, new_name| [old_name, new_name, state[old_name]] if state.key?(old_name) }
      #   snapshot.each { |old_name, _new_name, _value| state.delete(old_name) }
      #   snapshot.each { |_old_name, new_name, value| state[new_name] = value }
      #
      # WHAT THIS COP DOES NOT ATTEMPT — the general checklist item is
      # broader than any AST pattern can safely automate ("any method
      # that both reads and writes the same collection across a loop"
      # covers plenty of correct code too — accumulating into a result
      # hash, memoizing into a cache). This cop stays narrow and
      # precise: only the EXACT `recv[x] = recv.delete(y)` shape, same
      # receiver both sides, inside something that iterates. A single
      # rename outside any loop is not this bug (nothing else can have
      # run first); `hash.store(...)` instead of `hash[...] =`, or
      # `hash.delete(...)` whose result is not immediately written back
      # into the SAME hash, are not this shape either and are left to
      # the broader code-review checklist item, not this cop.
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad — one rule at a time against the hash it reads from
      #   renames.each do |old_name, new_name|
      #     state[new_name] = state.delete(old_name)
      #   end
      #
      #   # good — snapshot first, then delete, then write: one permutation
      #   snapshot = renames.filter_map { |old_name, new_name| [old_name, new_name, state[old_name]] if state.key?(old_name) }
      #   snapshot.each { |old_name, _new_name, _value| state.delete(old_name) }
      #   snapshot.each { |_old_name, new_name, value| state[new_name] = value }
