      # FLAGS THE EXACT SHAPE behind 8+ real bugs already fixed one at a
      # time across this codebase (Tiers 1-5): `holder[a] || holder[b]` —
      # the SAME receiver looked up by two different keys, falling back to
      # the second lookup whenever the first is falsy. `||` cannot tell a
      # genuinely STORED `false` from a MISSING key — both are falsy in
      # Ruby — so a real `false` sitting at `holder[a]` is silently
      # discarded and `holder[b]` (usually absent, so `nil`) is returned
      # instead. Every one of those 8+ instances was the identical
      # AST shape with a different pair of keys (most commonly
      # `h[k.to_sym] || h[k]`, reading a value that could arrive keyed
      # either by symbol or by string off the wire).
      #
      # THE FIX THIS CODEBASE ALREADY CONVERGED ON — see
      # `lib/hecks/query_specification/field_path.rb#read`, the shared
      # digger this whole bug class got consolidated behind: check
      # `key?` FIRST, never fall back through `||`.
      #
      #   sym = segment.to_sym
      #   return current.key?(sym) ? current[sym] : current[segment]
      #
      # That method's own comment says it plainly: "`key?` first, never
      # `||`, because `||` falls through a genuinely-stored `false` to
      # the OTHER spelling (usually absent) and returns `nil` instead."
      # This cop exists so the NEXT `holder[a] || holder[b]` gets caught
      # mechanically, before it becomes bug #9, rather than found by
      # hand again in a future audit.
      #
      # SCOPED TO THE `[]`/`[]` SHAPE ONLY, deliberately — a receiver
      # method-call is compared by AST structure (`==`, which ignores
      # source location), so `hash[a] || hash[b]` is flagged whether
      # `hash` is a local variable, a method call, or a constant, but
      # `a[k] || b[k]` (DIFFERENT receivers) and `value || default`
      # (an ordinary default, not a second lookup at all) are both left
      # alone — neither one can silently drop a stored `false` the way
      # a same-receiver double-lookup can.
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad — a stored `false` at hash[:active] is discarded
      #   hash[:active] || hash["active"]
      #
      #   # good
      #   hash.key?(:active) ? hash[:active] : hash["active"]
      #
      #   # good — or the shared digger this codebase already has
      #   Hecks::QuerySpecification::FieldPath.dig(hash, "active")
