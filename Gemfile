# neither is a runtime dependency of the forms app itself,

# PINNED, NOT LEFT TO THE RESOLVER — oauth2's own dependency chain
# pulls in a real `json` gem where none was in this bundle before
# (Ruby's own bundled default, 2.7.2, answered every require here
# until now). A newer json gem changes JSON.pretty_generate's own
# formatting for an empty array/hash — spec/ir_golden_spec.rb and
# spec/reference_golden_spec.rb pin exact bytes against the default
# Ruby ships with, so an unpinned resolver silently upgrading json
# breaks fixtures that have nothing to do with oauth2 at all.
