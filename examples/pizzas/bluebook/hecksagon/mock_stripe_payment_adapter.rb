# A DRIVING ADAPTER, standing in for a real Stripe webhook handler — the
# same role a Rails controller would play (see docs/rails-integration.md's
# "Rails is a driving adapter, not a special one"), reduced to what's
# needed to demonstrate the shape without a real Stripe account. Boots
# Pizzas the normal way (bin/console's own path) and calls straight
# through Dispatcher#dispatch_port, exactly as a webhook controller would.
#
#   examples/pizzas/bluebook/hecksagon/mock_stripe_payment_adapter.rb
#
# LIVES BESIDE pizzas.hecksagon, DELIBERATELY — a `.hecksagon` file
# declares a port; a `hecksagon/` folder beside it holds the driving
# adapters that actually call one, the same pairing
# `lib/hecks/adapters/driven/` already has with `.adapter` files,
# mirrored for the opposite direction. Findable by walking there, not by
# knowing this file's name in advance.
#
# What this proves end to end: the port never touches Purchase's own
# business rules directly — it only translates an external fact
# ("this payment succeeded") into the domain's own event vocabulary
# (PizzaPaymentReceived), and OnPizzaPaymentReceived (pizzas.bluebook)
# is what actually triggers Purchase, given/then_set and all.
